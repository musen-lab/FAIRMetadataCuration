            "In-depth study of the pathogenesis of NSCLC is of great significance, for the discovery of new early clinical diagnosis strategies and treatment targets for NSCLC. Epigenetics has become a research hotspot in the field of life science in recent years, and research on noncoding RNAs including PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) is an important part of this field. An increasing number of studies have shown that piRNAs play an important role in silencing transposons and regulating messenger RNA (mRNA) and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA). In the field of cancer research, piRNAs may become new molecular markers and therapeutic targets."

            "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) drastically improve therapeutic outcomes for lung cancer, but accurate prediction of individual patient responses to ICIs remains a challenge. We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer. Our study suggests that cfDNA 5hmC analysis is a minimally invasive, innovative strategy for guiding treatment selection in lung cancer patients."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "Objectives: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and challenging diagnosis. Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.  Conclusion: This study proposes a miRNA-based biomarker classifier for SCLC that considers clinical demographics with specific cut offs to inform SCLC diagnosis."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TCs) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

            "Objectives: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and challenging diagnosis. Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.  Conclusion: This study proposes a miRNA-based biomarker classifier for SCLC that considers clinical demographics with specific cut offs to inform SCLC diagnosis."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

Histological and transcriptomic analyses confirmed that the main features from the original tumor were reproduced. The 3D tumor model could be used to determine the dynamics of response to antiangiogenic therapy and platinum-based chemotherapy. Antiangiogenic therapy showed a significant decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A expression, reflecting its therapeutic effect in the model.

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive and lethal type of lung cancer, characterized by limited treatment options, early and frequent metastasis. However, the determinants of metastasis in SCLC are poorly defined. Here, we show that estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERR\u03b3) is overexpressed in metastatic SCLC tumors, and it is positively associated with SCLC progression. ERR\u03b3 functions as an essential activator of ECM remodeling and cell adhesion, two critical steps in metastasis, by directly regulating the expression of major genes involved in these processes. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of ERR\u03b3 markedly reduces collagen production, cell-matrix adhesion, microfilaments production, and eventually blocks SCLC cell invasion and tumor metastasis. Notably, ERR\u03b3 antagonists significantly suppress tumor growth and metastasis and restore resistant SCLC vulnerability to chemotherapy in multiple cell-derived and patient-derived xenograft models. Taken together, these findings establish ERR\u03b3 as an attractive target for metastatic SCLC and provide a potential pharmacological strategy for treating this lethal disease."

ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity\u2014as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics.

            "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples. And the three miRNAs selected by DFL potentially represent an effective molecular signature for LUAD diagnosis."

            "Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, of which approximately 85% are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced NSCLC was significantly prolonged with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis. For early-stage lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate for patients ranges from 80% in stage IA to 41% in stage IIIA, and many cases relapse after surgical resection. Currently, multiple clinical trials have manifested the encouraging efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC. However, the effect of immunotherapy in ultra early-stage NSCLC patients with micro-invasive or even pre-invasive lesions remains unclear.

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response.

        "summary": [
            "Objectives: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and challenging diagnosis. Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.  Conclusion: This study proposes a miRNA-based biomarker classifier for SCLC that considers clinical demographics with specific cut offs to inform SCLC diagnosis."

            "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples.

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TCs) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

The vascularized, immune-infiltrated PDT model could be obtained within two weeks, matching the requirements of the therapeutic decision-making process. Histological and transcriptomic analyses confirmed that the main features from the original tumor were reproduced. The 3D tumor model could be used to determine the dynamics of response to antiangiogenic therapy and platinum-based chemotherapy. Antiangiogenic therapy showed a significant decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A expression, reflecting its therapeutic effect in the model. In an immune-infiltrated PDT model, chemotherapy showed the ability to decrease the levels of lymphocyte activation gene-3 protein (LAG-3), B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) and inhibitory receptors of T cells functions."

            "Tumor cells subvert immune surveillance by harnessing inhibitory signals to acquire immune resistance. Bispecific antibodies have been developed to direct cytotoxic T lymphocytes to the tumor site and foster their activities to reduce tumor immune resistance. Although applied with success, bispecific antibodies are not universally effective partially due to the expression of pro-survival factors by tumor cells. Here, we report a CRISPR/Cas9 screen in human non-small cell lung cancer for genes that confer tumors with increased resistance to T lymphocyte mediated killing. We show that lung carcinoma cells devoid of expression of the gene C22orf46 exhibit increased susceptibility to T cell induced apoptosis and genotoxic stress mediated by chemotherapeutic agents. We present data showing that C22orf46, previously annotated as a non-coding gene, encodes an expressed nucleolar protein with remote homologies to the BH domain-containing Bcl-2 family and propose to name this protein Tumor Apoptosis Associated Protein 1 (TAAP1). Collectively, our findings establish TAAP1/C22orf46 as a pro-survival oncogene with possible implications to therapy"

            "The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TCs) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

            "Objectives: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and challenging diagnosis. Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.  Conclusion: This study proposes a miRNA-based biomarker classifier for SCLC that considers clinical demographics with specific cut offs to inform SCLC diagnosis."

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, of which approximately 85% are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced NSCLC was significantly prolonged with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis. For early-stage lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate for patients ranges from 80% in stage IA to 41% in stage IIIA, and many cases relapse after surgical resection. Currently, multiple clinical trials have manifested the encouraging efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC. However, the effect of immunotherapy in ultra early-stage NSCLC patients with micro-invasive or even pre-invasive lesions remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the activity and safety of sintilimab on high-risk ground glass opacity lesions in multiple primary lung cancer patients."

ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity\u2014as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics.

We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils.

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "Squamous cell lung cancer (LUSC) is a frequently diagnosed histological subtype of lung malignancy associated with high mortality due to limited number of treatment options. Identification of potential targets suitable for drug development using high-throughput methods is still lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to analyze expression profiles of mRNA and miRNA in LUSC, aiming to identify the key molecules associated with tumorigenesis and prognosis (overall survival; OS). We performed differential gene expression analysis, pathway enrichment analysis and gene ontology analysis on RNA-seq data obtained from 23 FFPE tumor samples and 3 FFPE healthy individuals. TCGA LUSC and GTEx healthy donors\u2019 cohorts were used for validation. We identified 1133 up-regulated and 644 down-regulated genes, common for both cohorts. The most significant up-regulated genes were involved in cell-cycle regulation pathways, while down-regulated genes predominately belonged to immune-related pathways. Survival analysis performed on selected genes, commonly dysregulated in both cohorts and performed only on non-metastatic patients, identified novel prognostic biomarkers associated with OS in early-stage LUSC patients (HOXC4-worse OS, p=0.0001; LILRA5-better OS, p=0.0086). In total, 50 differentially expressed genes are correlated with patients\u2019 OS. Aiming to get better insight into the profile of the tumor microenvironment, we estimated levels of immune-cells infiltration in LUSC and identified 4 subtypes based on immune-cell infiltration levels. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built based on differentially expressed genes, and PPI modules and hub-genes were identified. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was conducted to identify significant modules and hub-genes in correlation to clinical traits. Differential analysis on miRNA-Seq data, obtained from 16 tumor and 4 healthy tissue samples, was conducted as well. 75 up-regulated and 47 down-regulated miRNAs were identified. Further, targets of differentially expressed miRNA were identified, following gene ontology analysis and miRNA-mRNA networks construction."

            "We identified a critical oncogenic role for Protocadherin 7 (PCDH7), a cell surface protein and member of the Cadherin superfamily in NSCLC. PCDH7 is frequently overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and associates with poor clinical outcome. Depletion of Pcdh7 reduces lung tumor burden and prolongs survival in mouse models of high-grade NSCLC, demonstrating that this protein is an actionable therapeutic target. Here we report the development and characterization of high affinity anti-PCDH7 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that inhibit downstream MAPK pathway activation and suppress tumor growth in multiple mouse models, including KRAS- and EGFR-mutant models. A lead mAb (mAb7) sensitized tumors to the FDA-approved MEK inhibitor trametinib. Moreover, the humanized mAb7-IgG1 exhibited antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and Fc-mediated immune effector killing of tumor cells in vivo.  These findings provide an important step towards the clinical development of PCDH7-targeting antibodies for the treatment of NSCLC and other tumor types with high PCDH7 expression."

Metastasis to the brain is a severe complication for 45% of patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer that drastically reduces their quality of life and survival. Here, we demonstrate that genetic inhibition of S100A9, ALDH1A1, RAR, or pharmacological inhibition of the RA pathway using pan-RAR inhibitors significantly reduces brain relapse from osimertinib-refractory cancer cells. Our study has therefore revealed a novel S100A9-ALDH1A1-RA signaling axis in the EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells that drives osimertinib-refractory metastatic brain relapse and identified a potential vulnerability in lung cancer cells that can be therapeutically targeted to prolong progression-free survival in EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified over fifty genomic loci associated with lung cancer risk. However, the genetic mechanisms and target genes underlying these loci are largely unknown, as most risk-associated-variants might regulate gene expression in a context-specific manner. Here, we generated a barcode-shared multiome (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map) of 117,911 human lung cells from ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes. Our multiome dataset identified lung cancer susceptibility genes that were not detected in previous tissue- or cell-line-based approaches and further revealed the cell types and contexts where the susceptibility genes are functional, including the interplay of epithelial and immune cell types even in a single locus."

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

Here, we establish a new, highly-penetrant, genetically-engineered mouse model of ONB with alterations in Rb1/Trp53/Myc that exhibit a NEUROD1+ immature neuronal state. ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity\u2014as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer. Our study suggests that cfDNA 5hmC analysis is a minimally invasive, innovative strategy for guiding treatment selection in lung cancer patients."

Bispecific antibodies have been developed to direct cytotoxic T lymphocytes to the tumor site and foster their activities to reduce tumor immune resistance. Although applied with success, bispecific antibodies are not universally effective partially due to the expression of pro-survival factors by tumor cells. Here, we report a CRISPR/Cas9 screen in human non-small cell lung cancer for genes that confer tumors with increased resistance to T lymphocyte mediated killing. We show that lung carcinoma cells devoid of expression of the gene C22orf46 exhibit increased susceptibility to T cell induced apoptosis and genotoxic stress mediated by chemotherapeutic agents. We present data showing that C22orf46, previously annotated as a non-coding gene, encodes an expressed nucleolar protein with remote homologies to the BH domain-containing Bcl-2 family and propose to name this protein Tumor Apoptosis Associated Protein 1 (TAAP1).

We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils.

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity\u2014as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics.

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "The olfactory epithelium relies on active neuron regeneration from basal stem cells and is susceptible to olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB), a rare, aggressive tumor of unclear origins. Here, we establish a new, highly-penetrant, genetically-engineered mouse model of ONB with alterations in Rb1/Trp53/Myc that exhibit a NEUROD1+ immature neuronal state. ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity\u2014as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics. Collectively, our findings highlight conserved developmental trajectories between ONB and SCLC subtypes with significant implications for ONB classification and treatment."

We observed increased fractions of exhausted CD8+ T cells, CCL18+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and LAMP3+ dendritic cells (DCs) in the immune component of NSCLC with COPD compared with the findings in NSCLC without COPD. Remarkably, a critical cluster of malignant cells from NSCLC with COPD samples, characterized by high expression of CD74, significantly exhibited an epithelial-immune dual signature and was associated with poor prognosis. Interestingly, we found that CD74 facilitated phosphorylation of MAPK/STAT3 to mediate PD-L1 expression and further suppressed CD8+ T cell function, triggering LC progression. Our study provides a comprehensive profiling of the multi-cellular ecosystem of NSCLC with coexisting COPD and reveals that CD74+ cancer cells are potential targets for immunotherapy."

            "Squamous cell lung cancer (LUSC) is a frequently diagnosed histological subtype of lung malignancy associated with high mortality due to limited number of treatment options. Identification of potential targets suitable for drug development using high-throughput methods is still lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to analyze expression profiles of mRNA and miRNA in LUSC, aiming to identify the key molecules associated with tumorigenesis and prognosis (overall survival; OS). We performed differential gene expression analysis, pathway enrichment analysis and gene ontology analysis on RNA-seq data obtained from 23 FFPE tumor samples and 3 FFPE healthy individuals. TCGA LUSC and GTEx healthy donors\u2019 cohorts were used for validation. We identified 1133 up-regulated and 644 down-regulated genes, common for both cohorts. The most significant up-regulated genes were involved in cell-cycle regulation pathways, while down-regulated genes predominately belonged to immune-related pathways. Survival analysis performed on selected genes, commonly dysregulated in both cohorts and performed only on non-metastatic patients, identified novel prognostic biomarkers associated with OS in early-stage LUSC patients (HOXC4-worse OS, p=0.0001; LILRA5-better OS, p=0.0086). In total, 50 differentially expressed genes are correlated with patients\u2019 OS. Aiming to get better insight into the profile of the tumor microenvironment, we estimated levels of immune-cells infiltration in LUSC and identified 4 subtypes based on immune-cell infiltration levels. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built based on differentially expressed genes, and PPI modules and hub-genes were identified. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was conducted to identify significant modules and hub-genes in correlation to clinical traits. Differential analysis on miRNA-Seq data, obtained from 16 tumor and 4 healthy tissue samples, was conducted as well. 75 up-regulated and 47 down-regulated miRNAs were identified. Further, targets of differentially expressed miRNA were identified, following gene ontology analysis and miRNA-mRNA networks construction."

Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls).

We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TCs) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

        "summary": [
            "Prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2 (PHD2) is one of the intracellular oxygen sensors that mediates proteasomal degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-\u03b1 via hydroxylation under normoxia. Because of its canonical function in the hypoxia signaling pathway, PHD2 is generally regarded as a tumor suppressor. However, the effects of PHD2 in tumorigenesis are not entirely dependent on HIF-\u03b1. Based on the data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we found that the expression of PHD2 is upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for approximately 80-85% of lung cancers, suggesting that PHD2 may play an important role in NSCLC. However, the function of PHD2 in NSCLC remains largely unknown. In this study, we established PHD2-deficient H1299 cells to investigate the function of PHD2 in NSCLC, and found that PHD2 suppressed cell proliferation and metabolism, but induced ROS levels in human NSCLC cells. Further results indicated that the function of PHD2 in NSCLC is dependent on its enzymatic activity and partially independent of HIF. Moreover, we performed RNA-seq and transcriptomics analysis to explore the underlying mechanisms, and identified some potential targets and pathways regulated by PHD2, apart from the canonical HIF-mediated hypoxia signaling pathway. These results provide some clues to uncover novel roles of PHD2 in lung cancer progression."

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

For early-stage lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate for patients ranges from 80% in stage IA to 41% in stage IIIA, and many cases relapse after surgical resection. Currently, multiple clinical trials have manifested the encouraging efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC.

            "The olfactory epithelium relies on active neuron regeneration from basal stem cells and is susceptible to olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB), a rare, aggressive tumor of unclear origins. Here, we establish a new, highly-penetrant, genetically-engineered mouse model of ONB with alterations in Rb1/Trp53/Myc that exhibit a NEUROD1+ immature neuronal state. ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity\u2014as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics. Collectively, our findings highlight conserved developmental trajectories between ONB and SCLC subtypes with significant implications for ONB classification and treatment."

ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression.

Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer. Our study suggests that cfDNA 5hmC analysis is a minimally invasive, innovative strategy for guiding treatment selection in lung cancer patients."

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

            "Objectives: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and challenging diagnosis. Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.  Conclusion: This study proposes a miRNA-based biomarker classifier for SCLC that considers clinical demographics with specific cut offs to inform SCLC diagnosis."

            "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) drastically improve therapeutic outcomes for lung cancer, but accurate prediction of individual patient responses to ICIs remains a challenge. We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer. Our study suggests that cfDNA 5hmC analysis is a minimally invasive, innovative strategy for guiding treatment selection in lung cancer patients."

            "The olfactory epithelium relies on active neuron regeneration from basal stem cells and is susceptible to olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB), a rare, aggressive tumor of unclear origins. Here, we establish a new, highly-penetrant, genetically-engineered mouse model of ONB with alterations in Rb1/Trp53/Myc that exhibit a NEUROD1+ immature neuronal state. ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity\u2014as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics. Collectively, our findings highlight conserved developmental trajectories between ONB and SCLC subtypes with significant implications for ONB classification and treatment."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TCs) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

            "Objectives: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and challenging diagnosis. Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.  Conclusion: This study proposes a miRNA-based biomarker classifier for SCLC that considers clinical demographics with specific cut offs to inform SCLC diagnosis."

            "To better elucidate the complex interaction between COPD and NSCLC, we comprehensively characterized immune cell dynamics and transcriptome profiles of malignant cells in tumor tissues from NSCLC patients with COPD using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We observed increased fractions of exhausted CD8+ T cells, CCL18+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and LAMP3+ dendritic cells (DCs) in the immune component of NSCLC with COPD compared with the findings in NSCLC without COPD. Remarkably, a critical cluster of malignant cells from NSCLC with COPD samples, characterized by high expression of CD74, significantly exhibited an epithelial-immune dual signature and was associated with poor prognosis. Interestingly, we found that CD74 facilitated phosphorylation of MAPK/STAT3 to mediate PD-L1 expression and further suppressed CD8+ T cell function, triggering LC progression. Our study provides a comprehensive profiling of the multi-cellular ecosystem of NSCLC with coexisting COPD and reveals that CD74+ cancer cells are potential targets for immunotherapy."

            "High dose intravenous vitamin C (IVC) has been proposed as a pro-oxidant anticancer agent. However, there lack biomarkers that are specific for this treatment. Here we explored profiles of gene expression responding to IVC treatment in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells as an effort for potential biomarker discovery. Genome-wide RNA-seq was performed in human NSCLC cell lines treated with pharmacological concentrations of vitamin C\uff08VitC\uff09 for differential expression of genes. The identified genes were analyzed for correlations with patient prognosis using data from the Kaplan-Meier Plotter and the Human Protein Atlas databases. Further, tumor samples from a retrospective study of 153 NSCLC patients were analyzed with immunohistochemistry for expression of targeted genes, and patient prognosis was correlated to these genes. Two genes, namely SERPINE1 and SERPINB7 were found to be downregulated in NSCLC cells following VitC treatment. Combined patient data from the cohort analysis and online databases revealed that these 2 genes presented an unfavorable prognostic prediction of overall survival (OS) in NSCLC patients receiving standard of care. However, high expression level of these 2 genes were associated with prolonged OS in NSCLC patients receiving IVC in addition to standard of care. These data revealed that SERPINE1 and SERPINB7 have the potential to serve as predictive factors indicating favorable responses to IVC treatment in patients with NSCLC. Further validations are warranted."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

            "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified over fifty genomic loci associated with lung cancer risk. However, the genetic mechanisms and target genes underlying these loci are largely unknown, as most risk-associated-variants might regulate gene expression in a context-specific manner. Here, we generated a barcode-shared multiome (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map) of 117,911 human lung cells from ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes. Our multiome dataset identified lung cancer susceptibility genes that were not detected in previous tissue- or cell-line-based approaches and further revealed the cell types and contexts where the susceptibility genes are functional, including the interplay of epithelial and immune cell types even in a single locus."

            "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples. And the three miRNAs selected by DFL potentially represent an effective molecular signature for LUAD diagnosis."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

For early-stage lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate for patients ranges from 80% in stage IA to 41% in stage IIIA, and many cases relapse after surgical resection. Currently, multiple clinical trials have manifested the encouraging efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC. However, the effect of immunotherapy in ultra early-stage NSCLC patients with micro-invasive or even pre-invasive lesions remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the activity and safety of sintilimab on high-risk ground glass opacity lesions in multiple primary lung cancer patients."

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.

            "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples. And the three miRNAs selected by DFL potentially represent an effective molecular signature for LUAD diagnosis."

Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples. And the three miRNAs selected by DFL potentially represent an effective molecular signature for LUAD diagnosis."

We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils.

Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

However, the genetic mechanisms and target genes underlying these loci are largely unknown, as most risk-associated-variants might regulate gene expression in a context-specific manner. Here, we generated a barcode-shared multiome (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map) of 117,911 human lung cells from ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes. Our multiome dataset identified lung cancer susceptibility genes that were not detected in previous tissue- or cell-line-based approaches and further revealed the cell types and contexts where the susceptibility genes are functional, including the interplay of epithelial and immune cell types even in a single locus."

            "Squamous cell lung cancer (LUSC) is a frequently diagnosed histological subtype of lung malignancy associated with high mortality due to limited number of treatment options. Identification of potential targets suitable for drug development using high-throughput methods is still lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to analyze expression profiles of mRNA and miRNA in LUSC, aiming to identify the key molecules associated with tumorigenesis and prognosis (overall survival; OS). We performed differential gene expression analysis, pathway enrichment analysis and gene ontology analysis on RNA-seq data obtained from 23 FFPE tumor samples and 3 FFPE healthy individuals. TCGA LUSC and GTEx healthy donors\u2019 cohorts were used for validation. We identified 1133 up-regulated and 644 down-regulated genes, common for both cohorts. The most significant up-regulated genes were involved in cell-cycle regulation pathways, while down-regulated genes predominately belonged to immune-related pathways. Survival analysis performed on selected genes, commonly dysregulated in both cohorts and performed only on non-metastatic patients, identified novel prognostic biomarkers associated with OS in early-stage LUSC patients (HOXC4-worse OS, p=0.0001; LILRA5-better OS, p=0.0086). In total, 50 differentially expressed genes are correlated with patients\u2019 OS. Aiming to get better insight into the profile of the tumor microenvironment, we estimated levels of immune-cells infiltration in LUSC and identified 4 subtypes based on immune-cell infiltration levels. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built based on differentially expressed genes, and PPI modules and hub-genes were identified. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was conducted to identify significant modules and hub-genes in correlation to clinical traits. Differential analysis on miRNA-Seq data, obtained from 16 tumor and 4 healthy tissue samples, was conducted as well. 75 up-regulated and 47 down-regulated miRNAs were identified. Further, targets of differentially expressed miRNA were identified, following gene ontology analysis and miRNA-mRNA networks construction."

ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression.

Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer.

We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer. Our study suggests that cfDNA 5hmC analysis is a minimally invasive, innovative strategy for guiding treatment selection in lung cancer patients."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TCs) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

The overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced NSCLC was significantly prolonged with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis. For early-stage lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate for patients ranges from 80% in stage IA to 41% in stage IIIA, and many cases relapse after surgical resection. Currently, multiple clinical trials have manifested the encouraging efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC. However, the effect of immunotherapy in ultra early-stage NSCLC patients with micro-invasive or even pre-invasive lesions remains unclear.

            "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified over fifty genomic loci associated with lung cancer risk. However, the genetic mechanisms and target genes underlying these loci are largely unknown, as most risk-associated-variants might regulate gene expression in a context-specific manner. Here, we generated a barcode-shared multiome (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map) of 117,911 human lung cells from ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes. Our multiome dataset identified lung cancer susceptibility genes that were not detected in previous tissue- or cell-line-based approaches and further revealed the cell types and contexts where the susceptibility genes are functional, including the interplay of epithelial and immune cell types even in a single locus."

Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

            "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples. And the three miRNAs selected by DFL potentially represent an effective molecular signature for LUAD diagnosis."

The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity\u2014as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics.

We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer. Our study suggests that cfDNA 5hmC analysis is a minimally invasive, innovative strategy for guiding treatment selection in lung cancer patients."

            "Prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2 (PHD2) is one of the intracellular oxygen sensors that mediates proteasomal degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-\u03b1 via hydroxylation under normoxia. Because of its canonical function in the hypoxia signaling pathway, PHD2 is generally regarded as a tumor suppressor. However, the effects of PHD2 in tumorigenesis are not entirely dependent on HIF-\u03b1. Based on the data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we found that the expression of PHD2 is upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for approximately 80-85% of lung cancers, suggesting that PHD2 may play an important role in NSCLC. However, the function of PHD2 in NSCLC remains largely unknown. In this study, we established PHD2-deficient H1299 cells to investigate the function of PHD2 in NSCLC, and found that PHD2 suppressed cell proliferation and metabolism, but induced ROS levels in human NSCLC cells. Further results indicated that the function of PHD2 in NSCLC is dependent on its enzymatic activity and partially independent of HIF. Moreover, we performed RNA-seq and transcriptomics analysis to explore the underlying mechanisms, and identified some potential targets and pathways regulated by PHD2, apart from the canonical HIF-mediated hypoxia signaling pathway. These results provide some clues to uncover novel roles of PHD2 in lung cancer progression."

            "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples. And the three miRNAs selected by DFL potentially represent an effective molecular signature for LUAD diagnosis."

            "The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TCs) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

However, the genetic mechanisms and target genes underlying these loci are largely unknown, as most risk-associated-variants might regulate gene expression in a context-specific manner. Here, we generated a barcode-shared multiome (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map) of 117,911 human lung cells from ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes. Our multiome dataset identified lung cancer susceptibility genes that were not detected in previous tissue- or cell-line-based approaches and further revealed the cell types and contexts where the susceptibility genes are functional, including the interplay of epithelial and immune cell types even in a single locus."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples. And the three miRNAs selected by DFL potentially represent an effective molecular signature for LUAD diagnosis."

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer.

Here we explored profiles of gene expression responding to IVC treatment in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells as an effort for potential biomarker discovery. Genome-wide RNA-seq was performed in human NSCLC cell lines treated with pharmacological concentrations of vitamin C\uff08VitC\uff09 for differential expression of genes. The identified genes were analyzed for correlations with patient prognosis using data from the Kaplan-Meier Plotter and the Human Protein Atlas databases. Further, tumor samples from a retrospective study of 153 NSCLC patients were analyzed with immunohistochemistry for expression of targeted genes, and patient prognosis was correlated to these genes. Two genes, namely SERPINE1 and SERPINB7 were found to be downregulated in NSCLC cells following VitC treatment. Combined patient data from the cohort analysis and online databases revealed that these 2 genes presented an unfavorable prognostic prediction of overall survival (OS) in NSCLC patients receiving standard of care. However, high expression level of these 2 genes were associated with prolonged OS in NSCLC patients receiving IVC in addition to standard of care. These data revealed that SERPINE1 and SERPINB7 have the potential to serve as predictive factors indicating favorable responses to IVC treatment in patients with NSCLC.

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer. Our study suggests that cfDNA 5hmC analysis is a minimally invasive, innovative strategy for guiding treatment selection in lung cancer patients."

            "Objectives: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and challenging diagnosis. Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.  Conclusion: This study proposes a miRNA-based biomarker classifier for SCLC that considers clinical demographics with specific cut offs to inform SCLC diagnosis."

For early-stage lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate for patients ranges from 80% in stage IA to 41% in stage IIIA, and many cases relapse after surgical resection. Currently, multiple clinical trials have manifested the encouraging efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC. However, the effect of immunotherapy in ultra early-stage NSCLC patients with micro-invasive or even pre-invasive lesions remains unclear.

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

Metastasis to the brain is a severe complication for 45% of patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer that drastically reduces their quality of life and survival. Here, we demonstrate that genetic inhibition of S100A9, ALDH1A1, RAR, or pharmacological inhibition of the RA pathway using pan-RAR inhibitors significantly reduces brain relapse from osimertinib-refractory cancer cells. Our study has therefore revealed a novel S100A9-ALDH1A1-RA signaling axis in the EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells that drives osimertinib-refractory metastatic brain relapse and identified a potential vulnerability in lung cancer cells that can be therapeutically targeted to prolong progression-free survival in EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients."

            "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified over fifty genomic loci associated with lung cancer risk. However, the genetic mechanisms and target genes underlying these loci are largely unknown, as most risk-associated-variants might regulate gene expression in a context-specific manner. Here, we generated a barcode-shared multiome (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map) of 117,911 human lung cells from ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes. Our multiome dataset identified lung cancer susceptibility genes that were not detected in previous tissue- or cell-line-based approaches and further revealed the cell types and contexts where the susceptibility genes are functional, including the interplay of epithelial and immune cell types even in a single locus."

        ],
        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

        "summary": [
            "Background: Accumulating evidence indicates that aberrant non-SMC condensin II complex subunit D3 (NCAPD3) is associated with carcinogenesis of various cancers. Nevertheless, the biological role of NCAPD3 in the pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear.Methods: Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were performed to assess NCAPD3 expression in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. The ability of cell proliferation, invasion, and migration was evaluated by CCK-8 assays, EdU assays, Transwell assays, and scratch wound healing assays. Flow cytometry was performed to verify the cell cycle and apoptosis. RNA-sequence and rescue experiment were performed to reveal the underlying mechanisms.Results: The results showed that the expression of NCAPD3 was significantly elevated in NSCLC tissues. In NSCLC patients, high NCAPD3 expression was substantially associated with a worse prognosis. Functionally, knockdown of NCAPD3 resulted in cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in NSCLC cells as well as a significant inhibition of proliferation, invasion, and migration. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing analysis suggested that NCAPD3 contributes to NSCLC cancer carcinogenesis by regulating PI3K/Akt/FOXO4 pathway. Insulin-like growth factors-1 (IGF-1), a PI3K/Akt signaling activator, could reverse NCAPD3 silence-mediated proliferation inhibition and apoptosis in NSCLC cells.Conclusion: NCAPD3 suppresses apoptosis and promotes cell proliferation via the PI3K/Akt/FOXO4 signaling pathway, suggesting a potential use for NCAPD3 inhibitors as NSCLC therapeutics."

The vascularized, immune-infiltrated PDT model could be obtained within two weeks, matching the requirements of the therapeutic decision-making process. Histological and transcriptomic analyses confirmed that the main features from the original tumor were reproduced. The 3D tumor model could be used to determine the dynamics of response to antiangiogenic therapy and platinum-based chemotherapy. Antiangiogenic therapy showed a significant decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A expression, reflecting its therapeutic effect in the model. In an immune-infiltrated PDT model, chemotherapy showed the ability to decrease the levels of lymphocyte activation gene-3 protein (LAG-3), B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) and inhibitory receptors of T cells functions."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "Background: Accumulating evidence indicates that aberrant non-SMC condensin II complex subunit D3 (NCAPD3) is associated with carcinogenesis of various cancers. Nevertheless, the biological role of NCAPD3 in the pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear.Methods: Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were performed to assess NCAPD3 expression in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. The ability of cell proliferation, invasion, and migration was evaluated by CCK-8 assays, EdU assays, Transwell assays, and scratch wound healing assays. Flow cytometry was performed to verify the cell cycle and apoptosis. RNA-sequence and rescue experiment were performed to reveal the underlying mechanisms.Results: The results showed that the expression of NCAPD3 was significantly elevated in NSCLC tissues. In NSCLC patients, high NCAPD3 expression was substantially associated with a worse prognosis. Functionally, knockdown of NCAPD3 resulted in cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in NSCLC cells as well as a significant inhibition of proliferation, invasion, and migration. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing analysis suggested that NCAPD3 contributes to NSCLC cancer carcinogenesis by regulating PI3K/Akt/FOXO4 pathway. Insulin-like growth factors-1 (IGF-1), a PI3K/Akt signaling activator, could reverse NCAPD3 silence-mediated proliferation inhibition and apoptosis in NSCLC cells.Conclusion: NCAPD3 suppresses apoptosis and promotes cell proliferation via the PI3K/Akt/FOXO4 signaling pathway, suggesting a potential use for NCAPD3 inhibitors as NSCLC therapeutics."

For early-stage lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate for patients ranges from 80% in stage IA to 41% in stage IIIA, and many cases relapse after surgical resection. Currently, multiple clinical trials have manifested the encouraging efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC. However, the effect of immunotherapy in ultra early-stage NSCLC patients with micro-invasive or even pre-invasive lesions remains unclear.

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity\u2014as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics.

We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils.

Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

For early-stage lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate for patients ranges from 80% in stage IA to 41% in stage IIIA, and many cases relapse after surgical resection. Currently, multiple clinical trials have manifested the encouraging efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC.

In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

            "Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, of which approximately 85% are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced NSCLC was significantly prolonged with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis. For early-stage lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate for patients ranges from 80% in stage IA to 41% in stage IIIA, and many cases relapse after surgical resection. Currently, multiple clinical trials have manifested the encouraging efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC. However, the effect of immunotherapy in ultra early-stage NSCLC patients with micro-invasive or even pre-invasive lesions remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the activity and safety of sintilimab on high-risk ground glass opacity lesions in multiple primary lung cancer patients."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

Here, we establish a new, highly-penetrant, genetically-engineered mouse model of ONB with alterations in Rb1/Trp53/Myc that exhibit a NEUROD1+ immature neuronal state. ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity\u2014as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics.

Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.

            "The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TCs) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

            "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples. And the three miRNAs selected by DFL potentially represent an effective molecular signature for LUAD diagnosis."

            "Prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2 (PHD2) is one of the intracellular oxygen sensors that mediates proteasomal degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-\u03b1 via hydroxylation under normoxia. Because of its canonical function in the hypoxia signaling pathway, PHD2 is generally regarded as a tumor suppressor. However, the effects of PHD2 in tumorigenesis are not entirely dependent on HIF-\u03b1. Based on the data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we found that the expression of PHD2 is upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for approximately 80-85% of lung cancers, suggesting that PHD2 may play an important role in NSCLC. However, the function of PHD2 in NSCLC remains largely unknown. In this study, we established PHD2-deficient H1299 cells to investigate the function of PHD2 in NSCLC, and found that PHD2 suppressed cell proliferation and metabolism, but induced ROS levels in human NSCLC cells. Further results indicated that the function of PHD2 in NSCLC is dependent on its enzymatic activity and partially independent of HIF. Moreover, we performed RNA-seq and transcriptomics analysis to explore the underlying mechanisms, and identified some potential targets and pathways regulated by PHD2, apart from the canonical HIF-mediated hypoxia signaling pathway. These results provide some clues to uncover novel roles of PHD2 in lung cancer progression."

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

Bispecific antibodies have been developed to direct cytotoxic T lymphocytes to the tumor site and foster their activities to reduce tumor immune resistance. Although applied with success, bispecific antibodies are not universally effective partially due to the expression of pro-survival factors by tumor cells. Here, we report a CRISPR/Cas9 screen in human non-small cell lung cancer for genes that confer tumors with increased resistance to T lymphocyte mediated killing. We show that lung carcinoma cells devoid of expression of the gene C22orf46 exhibit increased susceptibility to T cell induced apoptosis and genotoxic stress mediated by chemotherapeutic agents. We present data showing that C22orf46, previously annotated as a non-coding gene, encodes an expressed nucleolar protein with remote homologies to the BH domain-containing Bcl-2 family and propose to name this protein Tumor Apoptosis Associated Protein 1 (TAAP1).

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer. Our study suggests that cfDNA 5hmC analysis is a minimally invasive, innovative strategy for guiding treatment selection in lung cancer patients."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified over fifty genomic loci associated with lung cancer risk. However, the genetic mechanisms and target genes underlying these loci are largely unknown, as most risk-associated-variants might regulate gene expression in a context-specific manner. Here, we generated a barcode-shared multiome (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map) of 117,911 human lung cells from ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes. Our multiome dataset identified lung cancer susceptibility genes that were not detected in previous tissue- or cell-line-based approaches and further revealed the cell types and contexts where the susceptibility genes are functional, including the interplay of epithelial and immune cell types even in a single locus."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "To better elucidate the complex interaction between COPD and NSCLC, we comprehensively characterized immune cell dynamics and transcriptome profiles of malignant cells in tumor tissues from NSCLC patients with COPD using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We observed increased fractions of exhausted CD8+ T cells, CCL18+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and LAMP3+ dendritic cells (DCs) in the immune component of NSCLC with COPD compared with the findings in NSCLC without COPD. Remarkably, a critical cluster of malignant cells from NSCLC with COPD samples, characterized by high expression of CD74, significantly exhibited an epithelial-immune dual signature and was associated with poor prognosis. Interestingly, we found that CD74 facilitated phosphorylation of MAPK/STAT3 to mediate PD-L1 expression and further suppressed CD8+ T cell function, triggering LC progression. Our study provides a comprehensive profiling of the multi-cellular ecosystem of NSCLC with coexisting COPD and reveals that CD74+ cancer cells are potential targets for immunotherapy."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

For early-stage lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate for patients ranges from 80% in stage IA to 41% in stage IIIA, and many cases relapse after surgical resection. Currently, multiple clinical trials have manifested the encouraging efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC.

In this study, we aimed to assess intratumoral transcriptomic subtype diversity and to identify biomarkers associated with long-term chemoimmunotherapy benefit in human ES-SCLC. Our work highlights that high intratumoral heterogeneity, lack of consistent association with outcome, and unclear subtype-specific target expression are major challenges for SCLC subtype-based precision oncology. Pre-existing IFN\u03d2-driven immunity and mitochondrial metabolism seem key correlates of long-term efficacy for chemoimmunotherapy in ES-SCLC."

            "Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, of which approximately 85% are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced NSCLC was significantly prolonged with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis. For early-stage lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate for patients ranges from 80% in stage IA to 41% in stage IIIA, and many cases relapse after surgical resection. Currently, multiple clinical trials have manifested the encouraging efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC. However, the effect of immunotherapy in ultra early-stage NSCLC patients with micro-invasive or even pre-invasive lesions remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the activity and safety of sintilimab on high-risk ground glass opacity lesions in multiple primary lung cancer patients."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Here we explored profiles of gene expression responding to IVC treatment in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells as an effort for potential biomarker discovery. Genome-wide RNA-seq was performed in human NSCLC cell lines treated with pharmacological concentrations of vitamin C\uff08VitC\uff09 for differential expression of genes. The identified genes were analyzed for correlations with patient prognosis using data from the Kaplan-Meier Plotter and the Human Protein Atlas databases. Further, tumor samples from a retrospective study of 153 NSCLC patients were analyzed with immunohistochemistry for expression of targeted genes, and patient prognosis was correlated to these genes. Two genes, namely SERPINE1 and SERPINB7 were found to be downregulated in NSCLC cells following VitC treatment. Combined patient data from the cohort analysis and online databases revealed that these 2 genes presented an unfavorable prognostic prediction of overall survival (OS) in NSCLC patients receiving standard of care. However, high expression level of these 2 genes were associated with prolonged OS in NSCLC patients receiving IVC in addition to standard of care. These data revealed that SERPINE1 and SERPINB7 have the potential to serve as predictive factors indicating favorable responses to IVC treatment in patients with NSCLC.

            "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified over fifty genomic loci associated with lung cancer risk. However, the genetic mechanisms and target genes underlying these loci are largely unknown, as most risk-associated-variants might regulate gene expression in a context-specific manner. Here, we generated a barcode-shared multiome (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map) of 117,911 human lung cells from ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes. Our multiome dataset identified lung cancer susceptibility genes that were not detected in previous tissue- or cell-line-based approaches and further revealed the cell types and contexts where the susceptibility genes are functional, including the interplay of epithelial and immune cell types even in a single locus."

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, of which approximately 85% are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced NSCLC was significantly prolonged with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis. For early-stage lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate for patients ranges from 80% in stage IA to 41% in stage IIIA, and many cases relapse after surgical resection. Currently, multiple clinical trials have manifested the encouraging efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC. However, the effect of immunotherapy in ultra early-stage NSCLC patients with micro-invasive or even pre-invasive lesions remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the activity and safety of sintilimab on high-risk ground glass opacity lesions in multiple primary lung cancer patients."

We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer. Our study suggests that cfDNA 5hmC analysis is a minimally invasive, innovative strategy for guiding treatment selection in lung cancer patients."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples. And the three miRNAs selected by DFL potentially represent an effective molecular signature for LUAD diagnosis."

However, the genetic mechanisms and target genes underlying these loci are largely unknown, as most risk-associated-variants might regulate gene expression in a context-specific manner. Here, we generated a barcode-shared multiome (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map) of 117,911 human lung cells from ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes. Our multiome dataset identified lung cancer susceptibility genes that were not detected in previous tissue- or cell-line-based approaches and further revealed the cell types and contexts where the susceptibility genes are functional, including the interplay of epithelial and immune cell types even in a single locus."

            "The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TCs) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

            "Background: Accumulating evidence indicates that aberrant non-SMC condensin II complex subunit D3 (NCAPD3) is associated with carcinogenesis of various cancers. Nevertheless, the biological role of NCAPD3 in the pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear.Methods: Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were performed to assess NCAPD3 expression in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. The ability of cell proliferation, invasion, and migration was evaluated by CCK-8 assays, EdU assays, Transwell assays, and scratch wound healing assays. Flow cytometry was performed to verify the cell cycle and apoptosis. RNA-sequence and rescue experiment were performed to reveal the underlying mechanisms.Results: The results showed that the expression of NCAPD3 was significantly elevated in NSCLC tissues. In NSCLC patients, high NCAPD3 expression was substantially associated with a worse prognosis. Functionally, knockdown of NCAPD3 resulted in cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in NSCLC cells as well as a significant inhibition of proliferation, invasion, and migration. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing analysis suggested that NCAPD3 contributes to NSCLC cancer carcinogenesis by regulating PI3K/Akt/FOXO4 pathway. Insulin-like growth factors-1 (IGF-1), a PI3K/Akt signaling activator, could reverse NCAPD3 silence-mediated proliferation inhibition and apoptosis in NSCLC cells.Conclusion: NCAPD3 suppresses apoptosis and promotes cell proliferation via the PI3K/Akt/FOXO4 signaling pathway, suggesting a potential use for NCAPD3 inhibitors as NSCLC therapeutics."

ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity\u2014as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics.

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1.

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

However, the genetic mechanisms and target genes underlying these loci are largely unknown, as most risk-associated-variants might regulate gene expression in a context-specific manner. Here, we generated a barcode-shared multiome (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map) of 117,911 human lung cells from ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes. Our multiome dataset identified lung cancer susceptibility genes that were not detected in previous tissue- or cell-line-based approaches and further revealed the cell types and contexts where the susceptibility genes are functional, including the interplay of epithelial and immune cell types even in a single locus."

            "Objectives: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and challenging diagnosis. Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.  Conclusion: This study proposes a miRNA-based biomarker classifier for SCLC that considers clinical demographics with specific cut offs to inform SCLC diagnosis."

            "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) drastically improve therapeutic outcomes for lung cancer, but accurate prediction of individual patient responses to ICIs remains a challenge. We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer. Our study suggests that cfDNA 5hmC analysis is a minimally invasive, innovative strategy for guiding treatment selection in lung cancer patients."

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity\u2014as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics.

Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils.

            "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified over fifty genomic loci associated with lung cancer risk. However, the genetic mechanisms and target genes underlying these loci are largely unknown, as most risk-associated-variants might regulate gene expression in a context-specific manner. Here, we generated a barcode-shared multiome (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map) of 117,911 human lung cells from ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes. Our multiome dataset identified lung cancer susceptibility genes that were not detected in previous tissue- or cell-line-based approaches and further revealed the cell types and contexts where the susceptibility genes are functional, including the interplay of epithelial and immune cell types even in a single locus."

Our study has therefore revealed a novel S100A9-ALDH1A1-RA signaling axis in the EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells that drives osimertinib-refractory metastatic brain relapse and identified a potential vulnerability in lung cancer cells that can be therapeutically targeted to prolong progression-free survival in EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients."

            "Objectives: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and challenging diagnosis. Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.  Conclusion: This study proposes a miRNA-based biomarker classifier for SCLC that considers clinical demographics with specific cut offs to inform SCLC diagnosis."

            "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples. And the three miRNAs selected by DFL potentially represent an effective molecular signature for LUAD diagnosis."

Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples. And the three miRNAs selected by DFL potentially represent an effective molecular signature for LUAD diagnosis."

Metastasis to the brain is a severe complication for 45% of patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer that drastically reduces their quality of life and survival. Here, we demonstrate that genetic inhibition of S100A9, ALDH1A1, RAR, or pharmacological inhibition of the RA pathway using pan-RAR inhibitors significantly reduces brain relapse from osimertinib-refractory cancer cells. Our study has therefore revealed a novel S100A9-ALDH1A1-RA signaling axis in the EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells that drives osimertinib-refractory metastatic brain relapse and identified a potential vulnerability in lung cancer cells that can be therapeutically targeted to prolong progression-free survival in EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients."

        "summary": [
            "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified over fifty genomic loci associated with lung cancer risk. However, the genetic mechanisms and target genes underlying these loci are largely unknown, as most risk-associated-variants might regulate gene expression in a context-specific manner. Here, we generated a barcode-shared multiome (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map) of 117,911 human lung cells from ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes. Our multiome dataset identified lung cancer susceptibility genes that were not detected in previous tissue- or cell-line-based approaches and further revealed the cell types and contexts where the susceptibility genes are functional, including the interplay of epithelial and immune cell types even in a single locus."

            "Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, of which approximately 85% are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced NSCLC was significantly prolonged with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis. For early-stage lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate for patients ranges from 80% in stage IA to 41% in stage IIIA, and many cases relapse after surgical resection. Currently, multiple clinical trials have manifested the encouraging efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC. However, the effect of immunotherapy in ultra early-stage NSCLC patients with micro-invasive or even pre-invasive lesions remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the activity and safety of sintilimab on high-risk ground glass opacity lesions in multiple primary lung cancer patients."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive and lethal type of lung cancer, characterized by limited treatment options, early and frequent metastasis. However, the determinants of metastasis in SCLC are poorly defined. Here, we show that estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERR\u03b3) is overexpressed in metastatic SCLC tumors, and it is positively associated with SCLC progression. ERR\u03b3 functions as an essential activator of ECM remodeling and cell adhesion, two critical steps in metastasis, by directly regulating the expression of major genes involved in these processes. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of ERR\u03b3 markedly reduces collagen production, cell-matrix adhesion, microfilaments production, and eventually blocks SCLC cell invasion and tumor metastasis. Notably, ERR\u03b3 antagonists significantly suppress tumor growth and metastasis and restore resistant SCLC vulnerability to chemotherapy in multiple cell-derived and patient-derived xenograft models. Taken together, these findings establish ERR\u03b3 as an attractive target for metastatic SCLC and provide a potential pharmacological strategy for treating this lethal disease."

            "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified over fifty genomic loci associated with lung cancer risk. However, the genetic mechanisms and target genes underlying these loci are largely unknown, as most risk-associated-variants might regulate gene expression in a context-specific manner. Here, we generated a barcode-shared multiome (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map) of 117,911 human lung cells from ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes. Our multiome dataset identified lung cancer susceptibility genes that were not detected in previous tissue- or cell-line-based approaches and further revealed the cell types and contexts where the susceptibility genes are functional, including the interplay of epithelial and immune cell types even in a single locus."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer. Our study suggests that cfDNA 5hmC analysis is a minimally invasive, innovative strategy for guiding treatment selection in lung cancer patients."

Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.  Conclusion: This study proposes a miRNA-based biomarker classifier for SCLC that considers clinical demographics with specific cut offs to inform SCLC diagnosis."

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

        "summary": [
            "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples. And the three miRNAs selected by DFL potentially represent an effective molecular signature for LUAD diagnosis."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

        "summary": [
            "The urea cycle is frequently rewired in cancer cells to meet the metabolic demands of cancer, yet our understanding about the regulatory mechanisms for this pathway in different types of cancer is very limited. In this study, we discover that oncogenic activation of KRAS in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) silences the expression of arginosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1), a urea cycle enzyme catalyzing the production of arginine from aspartate and citrulline, and thereby diverts the utilization of aspartate to pyrimidine synthesis to meet the high demand for DNA replication in KRAS-mutant NSCLC. Specifically, KRAS signaling facilitates a hypo-acetylated state in the promoter region of ASS1 gene in a histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3)-dependent manner, which in turn impedes the recruitment of the transcription factor c-MYC for ASS1 transcription. ASS1 suppression in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cancer cells impairs the biosynthesis of arginine and renders growth dependency on SLC7A1, an arginine transmembrane transport, to import extracellular arginine. Depletion of SLC7A1 in both patient-derived organoid and xenograft models obtains a substantial therapeutic benefit in inhibiting KRAS-driven NSCLC growth. Together, our findings uncover a new role of oncogenic KRAS in rewiring urea cycle metabolism and identify SLC7A1-mediated arginine uptake as a therapeutic vulnerability in treating KRAS-mutant NSCLC."

            "Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, of which approximately 85% are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced NSCLC was significantly prolonged with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis. For early-stage lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate for patients ranges from 80% in stage IA to 41% in stage IIIA, and many cases relapse after surgical resection. Currently, multiple clinical trials have manifested the encouraging efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC. However, the effect of immunotherapy in ultra early-stage NSCLC patients with micro-invasive or even pre-invasive lesions remains unclear.

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified over fifty genomic loci associated with lung cancer risk. However, the genetic mechanisms and target genes underlying these loci are largely unknown, as most risk-associated-variants might regulate gene expression in a context-specific manner. Here, we generated a barcode-shared multiome (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map) of 117,911 human lung cells from ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes. Our multiome dataset identified lung cancer susceptibility genes that were not detected in previous tissue- or cell-line-based approaches and further revealed the cell types and contexts where the susceptibility genes are functional, including the interplay of epithelial and immune cell types even in a single locus."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples. And the three miRNAs selected by DFL potentially represent an effective molecular signature for LUAD diagnosis."

Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

Collectively, our findings highlight conserved developmental trajectories between ONB and SCLC subtypes with significant implications for ONB classification and treatment."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified over fifty genomic loci associated with lung cancer risk. However, the genetic mechanisms and target genes underlying these loci are largely unknown, as most risk-associated-variants might regulate gene expression in a context-specific manner. Here, we generated a barcode-shared multiome (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map) of 117,911 human lung cells from ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes. Our multiome dataset identified lung cancer susceptibility genes that were not detected in previous tissue- or cell-line-based approaches and further revealed the cell types and contexts where the susceptibility genes are functional, including the interplay of epithelial and immune cell types even in a single locus."

            "To better elucidate the complex interaction between COPD and NSCLC, we comprehensively characterized immune cell dynamics and transcriptome profiles of malignant cells in tumor tissues from NSCLC patients with COPD using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We observed increased fractions of exhausted CD8+ T cells, CCL18+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and LAMP3+ dendritic cells (DCs) in the immune component of NSCLC with COPD compared with the findings in NSCLC without COPD. Remarkably, a critical cluster of malignant cells from NSCLC with COPD samples, characterized by high expression of CD74, significantly exhibited an epithelial-immune dual signature and was associated with poor prognosis. Interestingly, we found that CD74 facilitated phosphorylation of MAPK/STAT3 to mediate PD-L1 expression and further suppressed CD8+ T cell function, triggering LC progression. Our study provides a comprehensive profiling of the multi-cellular ecosystem of NSCLC with coexisting COPD and reveals that CD74+ cancer cells are potential targets for immunotherapy."

        "summary": [
            "The urea cycle is frequently rewired in cancer cells to meet the metabolic demands of cancer, yet our understanding about the regulatory mechanisms for this pathway in different types of cancer is very limited. In this study, we discover that oncogenic activation of KRAS in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) silences the expression of arginosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1), a urea cycle enzyme catalyzing the production of arginine from aspartate and citrulline, and thereby diverts the utilization of aspartate to pyrimidine synthesis to meet the high demand for DNA replication in KRAS-mutant NSCLC. Specifically, KRAS signaling facilitates a hypo-acetylated state in the promoter region of ASS1 gene in a histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3)-dependent manner, which in turn impedes the recruitment of the transcription factor c-MYC for ASS1 transcription. ASS1 suppression in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cancer cells impairs the biosynthesis of arginine and renders growth dependency on SLC7A1, an arginine transmembrane transport, to import extracellular arginine. Depletion of SLC7A1 in both patient-derived organoid and xenograft models obtains a substantial therapeutic benefit in inhibiting KRAS-driven NSCLC growth. Together, our findings uncover a new role of oncogenic KRAS in rewiring urea cycle metabolism and identify SLC7A1-mediated arginine uptake as a therapeutic vulnerability in treating KRAS-mutant NSCLC."

The vascularized, immune-infiltrated PDT model could be obtained within two weeks, matching the requirements of the therapeutic decision-making process. Histological and transcriptomic analyses confirmed that the main features from the original tumor were reproduced. The 3D tumor model could be used to determine the dynamics of response to antiangiogenic therapy and platinum-based chemotherapy. Antiangiogenic therapy showed a significant decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A expression, reflecting its therapeutic effect in the model.

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TCs) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) drastically improve therapeutic outcomes for lung cancer, but accurate prediction of individual patient responses to ICIs remains a challenge. We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer. Our study suggests that cfDNA 5hmC analysis is a minimally invasive, innovative strategy for guiding treatment selection in lung cancer patients."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "Objectives: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and challenging diagnosis. Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.  Conclusion: This study proposes a miRNA-based biomarker classifier for SCLC that considers clinical demographics with specific cut offs to inform SCLC diagnosis."

ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity\u2014as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics.

Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

However, the genetic mechanisms and target genes underlying these loci are largely unknown, as most risk-associated-variants might regulate gene expression in a context-specific manner. Here, we generated a barcode-shared multiome (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map) of 117,911 human lung cells from ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes. Our multiome dataset identified lung cancer susceptibility genes that were not detected in previous tissue- or cell-line-based approaches and further revealed the cell types and contexts where the susceptibility genes are functional, including the interplay of epithelial and immune cell types even in a single locus."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) drastically improve therapeutic outcomes for lung cancer, but accurate prediction of individual patient responses to ICIs remains a challenge. We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer. Our study suggests that cfDNA 5hmC analysis is a minimally invasive, innovative strategy for guiding treatment selection in lung cancer patients."

Recent evidence supports plasticity among subtypes with a bias toward adoption of low-NE states during disease progression or upon acquired chemotherapy resistance. Here, we identify a role for SMARCA4, the catalytic subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, as a regulator of subtype shift in SCLC. SMARCA4 binds to gene loci encoding NE-lineage transcription factors ASCL1 and NEUROD1 and alters chromatin accessibility, suppressing NE programs. In parallel, SMARCA4 also controls REST, a known suppressor of the NE phenotype, by regulating SRRM4-dependent REST splicing. The SMARCA2/4 inhibitor FHD-286 induces loss of NE features and drives ERBB pathway activation in SCLC, rendering SCLC tumors sensitive to afatinib. This study nominates SMARCA4 as a key regulator of the NE state plasticity and defines a novel therapeutic strategy for SCLC."

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer.

            "Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive and lethal type of lung cancer, characterized by limited treatment options, early and frequent metastasis. However, the determinants of metastasis in SCLC are poorly defined. Here, we show that estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERR\u03b3) is overexpressed in metastatic SCLC tumors, and it is positively associated with SCLC progression. ERR\u03b3 functions as an essential activator of ECM remodeling and cell adhesion, two critical steps in metastasis, by directly regulating the expression of major genes involved in these processes. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of ERR\u03b3 markedly reduces collagen production, cell-matrix adhesion, microfilaments production, and eventually blocks SCLC cell invasion and tumor metastasis. Notably, ERR\u03b3 antagonists significantly suppress tumor growth and metastasis and restore resistant SCLC vulnerability to chemotherapy in multiple cell-derived and patient-derived xenograft models. Taken together, these findings establish ERR\u03b3 as an attractive target for metastatic SCLC and provide a potential pharmacological strategy for treating this lethal disease."

            "Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, of which approximately 85% are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced NSCLC was significantly prolonged with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis. For early-stage lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate for patients ranges from 80% in stage IA to 41% in stage IIIA, and many cases relapse after surgical resection. Currently, multiple clinical trials have manifested the encouraging efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC. However, the effect of immunotherapy in ultra early-stage NSCLC patients with micro-invasive or even pre-invasive lesions remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the activity and safety of sintilimab on high-risk ground glass opacity lesions in multiple primary lung cancer patients."

We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "Objectives: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and challenging diagnosis. Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.  Conclusion: This study proposes a miRNA-based biomarker classifier for SCLC that considers clinical demographics with specific cut offs to inform SCLC diagnosis."

ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity\u2014as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics.
