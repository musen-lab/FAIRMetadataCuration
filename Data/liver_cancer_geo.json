            "In this study, we investigated the biological roles and potential mechanisms of pentamethylquercetin (PMQ), a natural polymethyl flavones, against Hep3B liver cancer cells. Cell viability and growth curves were determined using the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay; flow cytometry was used to detect cell cycle and apoptosis; colony formation assay and JC-1 staining were used to detect cell proliferation and mitochondrial membrane potential changes, respectively. Transcriptome sequencing and western blotting were respectively used to investigate transcription and expression changes in Hep3B cells treated with PMQ. Treatment with 30 and 100 \u03bcM PMQ more significantly inhibited cell growth and proliferation in Hep3B cells than in HepG2 and LO2 cells. PMQ induced Hep3B cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by significantly reducing CDK4, CDK6, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E1, Cyclin B1 and Bcl-2 expression and increasing Bax, CDK1 and cleaved PARP levels. Transcriptomic profiles and western blotting results revealed that the MAPK and TNF signaling pathways may be involved in PMQ-induced Hep3B apoptosis."

            "Here, we generated full-length single cell transcriptome data for ~9,000 cells from clinical samples of 11 liver cancer patients to delineate cellular relationships of diverse malignant, immune and stromal cells. We identified an immunomodulatory fibroblast population, FAP+CCL19+CCL21+ CAFs, that expressed signatures of fibroblastic reticular cells and was associated with favorable prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These CAFs exhibited the potential to recruit NK cells and regulate tumor-associated macrophages, and appeared to be regulated by CXCL12+ endothelial cells in tumors through specific ligand-receptor interaction. Further, we uncovered clonal HBV integration events enriched in tumor cells, and trajectory analysis on tumor cells with clonal HBV integration events revealed that hepatoblast-like cells differentiated into a terminal state with high expression of an immune-resistance program. The intercellular crosstalks between CAFs and cancer cells, macrophages, and NK cells, combined with HBV-based lineage tracing, provide a better understanding for functional roles of CAFs in the HCC microenvironment, and the relationship between HBV integration and liver malignancies."

        "summary": [
            "Liver cancer claims over 800,000 human deaths each year. Liver cancer is notoriously refractory to conventional therapeutics. Further insight into the etiology carries promise for innovative diagnostics and therapeutics. Tumor progression is governed by interplay between tumor promoting genes and suppressor genes. BRD4, an acetyl-lysine binding protein, plays a critical role in development and human diseases. In many cancer types, BRD4 is overexpressed and promotes activation of a pro-tumor gene network. But the underlying mechanism for BRD4 overexpression remains elusive. As BRD4 has risen as a promising therapeutic target, to understand the mechanism regulating BRD4 protein level will shed insight into BRD4-targeting therapeutics. In this study, we find BRD4 protein level in liver cancer is significantly regulated by P53, the most frequently dysregulated tumor suppressor. We identify a strong negative correlation between protein levels of P53 and BRD4 in liver cancer. We then show P53 promotes BRD4 protein degradation. Mechanistically, P53 represses the transcription of USP1, a deubiquitinase, through P21-RB. We show USP1 is a deubiquitinase of BRD4, which increases its stability. We show the pro-tumor role of USP1 is partially mediated by BRD4 and the USP1-BRD4 axis upholds expression of a group of cancer-related genes. In summary, we identify a functional P53-P21-RB-USP1-BRD4 axis in liver cancer."

        "summary": [
            "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Hepatoblastoma (HB) are two liver cancers characterized by high gene deregulation, chromosomal rearrangements and typical mutations in genes related to the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin (Wnt) pathway. LHX2, a transcriptional factor member of the LIM homeobox gene family, has important functions in embryogenesis, liver development but also tumorigenesis. LHX2 is an oncogene in may solid tumors and leukemia but its role in liver cancer is unknown. To address this question we analyzed the expression of LHX2 in HCC and HB using various transcriptomic datasets and found a strong connection between LHX2 down-regulation and Wnt activation in these two liver cancers. In HB LHX2 downregulation correlated with multiple poor outcome parameters including higher patient age, intermediate- and high-risk tumors and patients\u2019 survival. A forced expression of LHX2 reduced the proliferation, the migration and the survival of hepatoma cells in vitro through the inactivation of MAPK/ERK and Wnt signalings. In vivo, LHX2 impeded the development of tumors in the chick embryo and repressed the Wnt pathway in Xenopus embryo. RNA-sequencing data and bioinformatic analyses confirmed the deregulation of many biological functions and molecular processes associated with cell migration, cell survival and liver carcinogenesis in LHX2-expressing hepatoma cells. At a mechanistic level, LHX2 induced the disassembling of beta-catenin and T-cell factor 4 and the expression of multiple inhibitors of Wnt (e.g. TLE/Groucho) and MAPK/ERK (e.g. DUSPs) pathways. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the tumor suppressive function of LHX2 in adult and pediatric liver cancers."

            "The clinical management of liver cancer is challenged by the reduced availability of drugs targeting key signaling pathways and their modest benefits to patients. Senescence induction may represent a strategy for cancer treatment, especially as a combination therapy. The posttranslational modification (PTM) of proteins critically influences many biological processes, including gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, tumor progression, and drug resistance. Herein, we newly discovered that the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Human antigen R (HuR), a hub in liver cancer, is SUMOylated in the tumor sections of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in contrast to the surrounding tissue, as well as in human cell line and mouse models of the disease. SUMOylation of HuR promotes major cancer hallmarks, namely proliferation and invasion, whereas the absence of HuR SUMOylation results in a senescent phenotype with dysfunctional mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mechanistically, SUMOylation induces a structural rearrangement of the RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that modulates HuR binding affinity to its target mRNAs further modifying the transcriptomic profile towards hepatic tumor progression."

Single-cell analysis revealed that IgG+ plasma cells preferentially accumulated in HCC while IgA+ plasma cells were preferentially enriched in CRLM.

            "Large-scale chromosomal aberrations are prevalent in human cancer but their functional effects remain poorly understood. We describe the establishment of chromosome-engineered hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines using a dual guided CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing strategy. A mega base-sized region on chromosome 8p (chr8p) was heterozygously deleted mimicking a frequently observed copy number alteration (CNA) of solid tumors. Using this unique model system, we delineated the functional consequences of chr8p loss and its impact on metastatic behavior and patient survival. We found that metastasis associated genes on chr8p act in concert to induce an aggressive and invasive phenotype characteristic for chr8p deleted tumors. The conjunction of engineered  chromosome-scale CNAs and genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 viability screenings served as a powerful tool for the discovery of novel synthetic lethal targets and vulnerabilities accompanying patient-specific copy number changes. Using this target identification strategy, we showed that chr8p deletion sensitizes tumor cells to targeting of the reactive oxygen sanitizing enzyme Nudix hydrolase 17 (NUDT17)."

Transcriptome sequencing and western blotting were respectively used to investigate transcription and expression changes in Hep3B cells treated with PMQ. Treatment with 30 and 100 \u03bcM PMQ more significantly inhibited cell growth and proliferation in Hep3B cells than in HepG2 and LO2 cells. PMQ induced Hep3B cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by significantly reducing CDK4, CDK6, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E1, Cyclin B1 and Bcl-2 expression and increasing Bax, CDK1 and cleaved PARP levels. Transcriptomic profiles and western blotting results revealed that the MAPK and TNF signaling pathways may be involved in PMQ-induced Hep3B apoptosis."

Here, we demonstrated that B cells are an important regulator in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) microenvironments. B cells displayed distinct developmental trajectories in HCC and CRLM. Single-cell analysis revealed that IgG+ plasma cells preferentially accumulated in HCC while IgA+ plasma cells were preferentially enriched in CRLM. Mechanistically, IgG+ plasma cells in HCC were recruited by tumor-associated macrophages via the CXCR3-CXCL10 axis, whereas IgA+ plasma cells in CRLM were recruited by metastatic tumor cells via CCR10-CCL28 signaling. Functionally, IgG+ plasma cells preferentially promoted pro-tumorigenic macrophages formation in HCC, and IgA+ plasma cells preferentially induced granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells activation in CRLM. Clinically, increased infiltration of IgG+ plasma cells and macrophages in HCC was correlated to worse survival, while increased intratumoral IgA+ plasma cells and neutrophils in CRLM indicated poor prognosis. Taken together, this study demonstrated plasma and myeloid cell-mediated immunosuppression in HCC and CRLM, suggesting that selectively modulating primary or secondary tumor-related immunosuppressive regulatory networks might reprogram the microenvironment and provide an immunotherapeutic strategy for treating liver cancer."

            "Liver cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies with an annual death of over 830,000 cases. Although targeted therapeutic drugs have achieved certain clinical efficacy, only sorafenib and lenvatinib are currently marketed as first-line targeted drugs to treat patients with advanced liver cancer. Therefore, developing more drugs are urgently needed. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent programmed cell death (PCD) distinct from known PCDs including apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. Targeting ferroptosis is recognized as a promising potential therapeutic modality for liver cancer. Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is an important ferroptosis inducer and targeting ATF3 offers a potential means to cancer therapy. In the present study, we reported for the first time a sophoridine derivative 6j with promising anti-liver cancer effects in vitro and in vivo. Compound 6j could induce liver cancer cells ferroptosis by promoting the accumulation of intracellular Fe2+, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and MDA. Inhibition of ferroptosis by ferrostatin-1 alleviated 6j induced accumulation of Fe2+, ROS, and MDA and restored cell viability. Further study revealed that compound 6j upregulated the expression of ATF3 via ER stress and knockdown of ATF3 by RNA interference attenuated 6j induced ferroptosis and cell proliferation inhibition. This study would provide new insights for the design of ferroptosis inducers and the development of anti-liver cancer drugs."

Notwithstanding the unique pathological feature of i-CHC, its molecular characteristics is not fully elucidated yet.",

            "Results: i-CHC showed unique transcriptomic features differing from HCC and iCCA, showing higher expression of Notch signaling and frequent splicing events of intron-retention (IR). Noticeably, we found that i-CHC had DNA-copy number loss and concomitant transcriptional suppression of METTL16, which may contribute to the aggressive progression of i-CHC via Notch activation.",

            "The rising incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a global problem. Several approved treatments, including immune therapy and multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are used for treatment, although the results are not optimum. There is an unmet need to develop highly effective chemotherapies for HCC. Targeting multiple pathways to attack cancer cells is beneficial. Cabozantinib is an orally available bioactive multikinase inhibitor and has a modest effect on HCC treatment. Silmitasertib is an orally bioavailable, potent CK2 inhibitor with a direct role in DNA damage repair and is in clinical trial for other cancers. In this study, we planned to repurpose these existing drugs on HCC treatment.  We observed stronger antiproliferative effect of these two combined drugs on HCC cells generated from different etiologies as compared to the single treatment. Global RNA-seq analyses revealed a decrease in the expression of G2/M cell cycle transition genes in HCC cells following combination treatment, suggesting G2 phase cell arrest. We observed G2/M cell cycle phase arrest in HCC cells upon combination treatment compared to the single-treated or vehicle-treated control cells. The downregulation of CCNA2 and CDC25C following combination therapy further supported the observation. Subsequent analyses demonstrated that combination treatment inhibited 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) phosphorylation, and increased Bim expression. Apoptosis of HCC cells were accompanied by increased poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and caspase-9 activation. Next, we observed that a combination therapy significantly delayed the progression of HCC xenograft growth as compared to vehicle control. Together, our results suggested combining cabozantinib and silmitasertib would be a promising treatment option for HCC."

            "Recent studies have shown that high cell cycle activity negatively correlates with antitumor immunity in certain cancer types. However, a similar correlation has not been proven in liver cancer.We downloaded transcriptomic profiles of TCGA-LIHC (the cancer genome atlas-liver hepatocellular carcinoma) and assessed the cell cycle distribution of samples using single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA), termed the cell cycle score (CCS). We obtained cell cycle-related differentially expressed prognostic genes and identified CENPA, CDC20 and CTSV using LASSO regression. We studied the effect of CTSV on clinical features and immune alterations in liver cancer based on TCGA-LIHC data. In vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to validate the role of CTSV in liver cancer using liver cancer cell lines and tissues.We found that the CCS closely correlated with the clinical features and prognosis of patients in TCGA-LIHC. Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), univariate Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression identified cathepsin V (CTSV) with prognostic significance in LIHC. Importantly, single-gene survival analysis of CTSV using microarray and sequencing data indicated that high levels of CTSV expression correlated with an unfavorable prognosis in various cancers. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that high CTSV expression closely correlated with decreased expression of metabolic genes and increased expression of cell cycle genes. Furthermore, difference and correlation analyses of the relationship between CTSV expression and immune infiltrates, determined using CIBERSORT and TIMER algorithms, revealed that CTSV expression correlated with macrophages and CD4+ T cells. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that knockdown of CTSV inhibited liver cancer cells proliferation. Immunohistochemical staining showed that high CTSV expression correlated with macrophage infiltration in liver cancer tissues, predicted a poor prognosis, and may serve as a biomarker for HCC therapy.In conclusion, CTSV is a novel cell cycle prognostic gene that can affect HCC cells proliferation, and a potential biomarker for HCC therapy."

            "Hexokinases (HKs), a group of enzymes catalyzing the first step of glycolysis, have been shown to play important roles in liver metabolism and tumorigenesis. Our recent studies identified HKDC1 as a top candidate associated with liver cancer metastasis. We aimed to compare its cell type specificity with other HKs upregulated in liver cancer and investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying its involvement in liver cancer metastasis. We found that, compared to HK1 and HK2, the other two commonly upregulated HKs in liver cancer, HKDC1 was most strongly associated with the metastasis potential of tumors and organoids derived from two liver cancer mouse models we previously established. RNA in situ hybridization and single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed that HKDC1 was specifically upregulated in malignant cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patient tumors, whereas HK1 and HK2 were widespread across various tumor microenvironment lineages. An unbiased metabolomic profiling demonstrated that HKDC1 overexpression in HCC cells led to metabolic alterations distinct from those from HK1 and HK2 overexpression, with HKDC1 particularly impacting the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. HKDC1 was prometastatic in HCC orthotopic and tail vein injection mouse models. Molecularly, HKDC1 was induced by hypoxia and bound to glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 to stabilize \u03b2-catenin, leading to enhanced stemness of HCC cells. Overall, our findings underscore HKDC1 as a prometastatic HK specifically expressed in the malignant compartment of primary liver tumors, thereby providing a mechanistic basis for targeting this enzyme in advanced liver cancer."

Senescence induction may represent a strategy for cancer treatment, especially as a combination therapy. The posttranslational modification (PTM) of proteins critically influences many biological processes, including gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, tumor progression, and drug resistance. Herein, we newly discovered that the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Human antigen R (HuR), a hub in liver cancer, is SUMOylated in the tumor sections of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in contrast to the surrounding tissue, as well as in human cell line and mouse models of the disease. SUMOylation of HuR promotes major cancer hallmarks, namely proliferation and invasion, whereas the absence of HuR SUMOylation results in a senescent phenotype with dysfunctional mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mechanistically, SUMOylation induces a structural rearrangement of the RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that modulates HuR binding affinity to its target mRNAs further modifying the transcriptomic profile towards hepatic tumor progression."

            "The transcriptional coactivators YAP/TAZ are the critical downstream regulators of the Hippo pathway that regulate gene expression in response to changes in pathway activity, mainly by binding to TEAD transcription factors. Uncontrolled transcriptional output of YAP/TAZ can lead to rapid induction of aggressive tumor growth. AP-1 is a dimeric basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor complex with JUN and FOS proteins being the most abundant members of this family. Unlike FOS, JUN can also form homodimers, but in the cell, JUN presumably preferentially forms heterodimers with members of the FOS family, which act as potent transcriptional activators. Previous studies identified substantial co-occupancy of YAP/TAZ and AP-1 at genomic sites, and they demonstrated that JUN/FOS heterodimers cooperate with the YAP/TAZ and TEAD transcription factors to drive YAP/TAZ target gene expression. Here, we now elucidate a negative feedback mechanism in which high YAP activity is restrained by the recruitment of homodimeric JUN::JUN/NCOR1 repressor complexes and show that this noncanonical JUN function is part of a tumor suppressor mechanism in the liver."

            "The protein diversity of mammalian cells is determined by arrays of isoforms from genes. Protein mutation is essential in species evolution and cancer development. Accurate Long-read transcriptome sequencing at single-cell level is required to decipher the spectrum of protein expressions in mammalian organisms. In this report, we developed a synthetic long-read single-cell sequencing technology based on LOOPseq technique. We applied this technology to analyze 447 transcriptomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and benign liver from an individual. Through Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) analysis, we identified a panel of mutation mRNA isoforms highly specific to HCC cells. The evolution pathways that led to the hyper-mutation clusters in single human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules were identified. Novel fusion transcripts were detected. The combination of gene expressions, fusion gene transcripts, and mutation gene expressions significantly improved the classification of liver cancer cells versus benign hepatocytes. In conclusion, LOOPseq single-cell technology may hold promise to provide a new level of precision analysis on the mammalian transcriptome."

        "summary": [
            "Earlier studies linked sorafenib effectiveness to induction of ferroptosis. Herein we demonstrate sorafenib and mTKIs downregulate DDX5 in vitro and in vivo. To understand the effect of DDX5 downregulation, we compared TCGA-derived HCCs expressing low vs. high DDX5 focusing on ferroptosis-related genes. Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key ferroptosis regulator, was significantly overexpressed in DDX5LOW HCCs. Importantly, DDX5-knockdown (DDX5KD) HCC cell lines lacked lipid peroxidation by GPX4 inhibition, indicating DDX5 downregulation suppresses ferroptosis. RNAseq analyses comparing wild type vs. DDX5KD cells in the presence or absence of sorafenib, identified a unique set of genes repressed by DDX5 and upregulated by sorafenib. This set significantly overlaps genes from Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways, including NF-\u03baB inducing Kinase required for non-canonical NF-\u03baB activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of these pathways in combination with sorafenib reduced DDX5KD cell viability. Mechanistically, sorafenib-mediated NF-\u03baB activation induced NRF2 transcription, while DDX5KD extended NRF2 half/life by stabilizing p62/SQSTM1, leading to enhanced expression of GPX4 and ferroptosis escape. Conclusion: Sorafenib/mTKI-mediated DDX5 downregulation results in adaptive mTKI resistance by enhancing NRF2 expression, leading to ferroptosis escape. We propose inhibition of the pathways leading to NRF2 expression will enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of sorafenib/mTKIs."

            "Large-scale chromosomal aberrations are prevalent in human cancer but their functional effects remain poorly understood. We describe the establishment of chromosome-engineered hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines using a dual guided CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing strategy. A mega base-sized region on chromosome 8p (chr8p) was heterozygously deleted mimicking a frequently observed copy number alteration (CNA) of solid tumors. Using this unique model system, we delineated the functional consequences of chr8p loss and its impact on metastatic behavior and patient survival. We found that metastasis associated genes on chr8p act in concert to induce an aggressive and invasive phenotype characteristic for chr8p deleted tumors. The conjunction of engineered  chromosome-scale CNAs and genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 viability screenings served as a powerful tool for the discovery of novel synthetic lethal targets and vulnerabilities accompanying patient-specific copy number changes. Using this target identification strategy, we showed that chr8p deletion sensitizes tumor cells to targeting of the reactive oxygen sanitizing enzyme Nudix hydrolase 17 (NUDT17)."

            "The tumor microenvironment is distinctive in primary and secondary liver cancer. B cells represent an important component of immune infiltrates. Here, we demonstrated that B cells are an important regulator in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) microenvironments. B cells displayed distinct developmental trajectories in HCC and CRLM. Single-cell analysis revealed that IgG+ plasma cells preferentially accumulated in HCC while IgA+ plasma cells were preferentially enriched in CRLM. Mechanistically, IgG+ plasma cells in HCC were recruited by tumor-associated macrophages via the CXCR3-CXCL10 axis, whereas IgA+ plasma cells in CRLM were recruited by metastatic tumor cells via CCR10-CCL28 signaling. Functionally, IgG+ plasma cells preferentially promoted pro-tumorigenic macrophages formation in HCC, and IgA+ plasma cells preferentially induced granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells activation in CRLM. Clinically, increased infiltration of IgG+ plasma cells and macrophages in HCC was correlated to worse survival, while increased intratumoral IgA+ plasma cells and neutrophils in CRLM indicated poor prognosis. Taken together, this study demonstrated plasma and myeloid cell-mediated immunosuppression in HCC and CRLM, suggesting that selectively modulating primary or secondary tumor-related immunosuppressive regulatory networks might reprogram the microenvironment and provide an immunotherapeutic strategy for treating liver cancer."

Uncontrolled transcriptional output of YAP/TAZ can lead to rapid induction of aggressive tumor growth. AP-1 is a dimeric basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor complex with JUN and FOS proteins being the most abundant members of this family. Unlike FOS, JUN can also form homodimers, but in the cell, JUN presumably preferentially forms heterodimers with members of the FOS family, which act as potent transcriptional activators. Previous studies identified substantial co-occupancy of YAP/TAZ and AP-1 at genomic sites, and they demonstrated that JUN/FOS heterodimers cooperate with the YAP/TAZ and TEAD transcription factors to drive YAP/TAZ target gene expression. Here, we now elucidate a negative feedback mechanism in which high YAP activity is restrained by the recruitment of homodimeric JUN::JUN/NCOR1 repressor complexes and show that this noncanonical JUN function is part of a tumor suppressor mechanism in the liver."

Additionally, hepatocytes showed a high degree of fat droplet accumulation during excessive alcohol consumption and metabolic syndrome. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in fat droplet formation remain unknown. This study used an in vitro fatty liver formation model of the human liver cancer cell line HepG2 to comprehensively search for fat droplet formation-related genes whose expression changes during fat droplet formation. Microarray analysis with extracted total RNA determined the genes that are involved in fat droplet formation and confirmed their expression by real-time polymerase chain reaction after culturing HepG2 cells in a culture medium containing 0, 50, 200, and 500 \u03bcM of oleic acid for 24 h. The results revealed 142 genes demonstrating increased expressions by >2.0 fold with oleic acid treatment and 426 genes demonstrating decreased expressions. Perilipin 2 (PLIN2) was estimated as the gene most closely associated with fatty liver. Lipid droplet formation in HepG2 upregulated PLIN2 in an oleic acid-treated concentration-dependent manner. These results indicate the involvement of genes in oleate treatment-induced lipid droplet formation in HepG2, particularly PLIN2 may play an important role."

These CAFs exhibited the potential to recruit NK cells and regulate tumor-associated macrophages, and appeared to be regulated by CXCL12+ endothelial cells in tumors through specific ligand-receptor interaction. Further, we uncovered clonal HBV integration events enriched in tumor cells, and trajectory analysis on tumor cells with clonal HBV integration events revealed that hepatoblast-like cells differentiated into a terminal state with high expression of an immune-resistance program. The intercellular crosstalks between CAFs and cancer cells, macrophages, and NK cells, combined with HBV-based lineage tracing, provide a better understanding for functional roles of CAFs in the HCC microenvironment, and the relationship between HBV integration and liver malignancies."

            "Hexokinases (HKs), a group of enzymes catalyzing the first step of glycolysis, have been shown to play important roles in liver metabolism and tumorigenesis. Our recent studies identified HKDC1 as a top candidate associated with liver cancer metastasis. We aimed to compare its cell type specificity with other HKs upregulated in liver cancer and investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying its involvement in liver cancer metastasis. We found that, compared to HK1 and HK2, the other two commonly upregulated HKs in liver cancer, HKDC1 was most strongly associated with the metastasis potential of tumors and organoids derived from two liver cancer mouse models we previously established. RNA in situ hybridization and single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed that HKDC1 was specifically upregulated in malignant cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patient tumors, whereas HK1 and HK2 were widespread across various tumor microenvironment lineages. An unbiased metabolomic profiling demonstrated that HKDC1 overexpression in HCC cells led to metabolic alterations distinct from those from HK1 and HK2 overexpression, with HKDC1 particularly impacting the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. HKDC1 was prometastatic in HCC orthotopic and tail vein injection mouse models. Molecularly, HKDC1 was induced by hypoxia and bound to glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 to stabilize \u03b2-catenin, leading to enhanced stemness of HCC cells. Overall, our findings underscore HKDC1 as a prometastatic HK specifically expressed in the malignant compartment of primary liver tumors, thereby providing a mechanistic basis for targeting this enzyme in advanced liver cancer."

            "Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a liver cancer of adolescents and young adults defined by fusion of the DNAJB1 heat shock protein and protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunit (DNAJB1-PRKACA). The resulting chimeric protein has increased kinase activity and is essential for FLC xenograft growth. However, the critical oncogenic pathways controlled by DNAJB1-PRKACA have not been defined. Here, we explored this question by studying patient-derived FLC models and engineered systems and analyzing patient samples. We show that the core function of DNAJB1-PRKACA is the direct phosphorylation and inactivation of the Salt-inducible kinases. This leads to deregulation of the CRTC2 co-activator and p300 acetyltransferase, resulting in transcriptional reprogramming and global increases in histone acetylation necessary for malignant growth. Our studies establish a central oncogenic mechanism of DNAJB1-PRKACA and suggest opportunities for therapeutic targeting of CRTC2/p300 in FLC. Notably, these findings link this signature fusion oncoprotein of a rare cancer type to more common cancer gene alterations involving the STK11 tumor suppressor and GNAS oncogene, which also function via SIK suppression."

B cells displayed distinct developmental trajectories in HCC and CRLM. Single-cell analysis revealed that IgG+ plasma cells preferentially accumulated in HCC while IgA+ plasma cells were preferentially enriched in CRLM. Mechanistically, IgG+ plasma cells in HCC were recruited by tumor-associated macrophages via the CXCR3-CXCL10 axis, whereas IgA+ plasma cells in CRLM were recruited by metastatic tumor cells via CCR10-CCL28 signaling. Functionally, IgG+ plasma cells preferentially promoted pro-tumorigenic macrophages formation in HCC, and IgA+ plasma cells preferentially induced granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells activation in CRLM. Clinically, increased infiltration of IgG+ plasma cells and macrophages in HCC was correlated to worse survival, while increased intratumoral IgA+ plasma cells and neutrophils in CRLM indicated poor prognosis. Taken together, this study demonstrated plasma and myeloid cell-mediated immunosuppression in HCC and CRLM, suggesting that selectively modulating primary or secondary tumor-related immunosuppressive regulatory networks might reprogram the microenvironment and provide an immunotherapeutic strategy for treating liver cancer."

            "Liver cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies with an annual death of over 830,000 cases. Although targeted therapeutic drugs have achieved certain clinical efficacy, only sorafenib and lenvatinib are currently marketed as first-line targeted drugs to treat patients with advanced liver cancer. Therefore, developing more drugs are urgently needed. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent programmed cell death (PCD) distinct from known PCDs including apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. Targeting ferroptosis is recognized as a promising potential therapeutic modality for liver cancer. Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is an important ferroptosis inducer and targeting ATF3 offers a potential means to cancer therapy. In the present study, we reported for the first time a sophoridine derivative 6j with promising anti-liver cancer effects in vitro and in vivo. Compound 6j could induce liver cancer cells ferroptosis by promoting the accumulation of intracellular Fe2+, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and MDA. Inhibition of ferroptosis by ferrostatin-1 alleviated 6j induced accumulation of Fe2+, ROS, and MDA and restored cell viability. Further study revealed that compound 6j upregulated the expression of ATF3 via ER stress and knockdown of ATF3 by RNA interference attenuated 6j induced ferroptosis and cell proliferation inhibition. This study would provide new insights for the design of ferroptosis inducers and the development of anti-liver cancer drugs."

            "Large-scale chromosomal aberrations are prevalent in human cancer but their functional effects remain poorly understood. We describe the establishment of chromosome-engineered hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines using a dual guided CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing strategy. A mega base-sized region on chromosome 8p (chr8p) was heterozygously deleted mimicking a frequently observed copy number alteration (CNA) of solid tumors. Using this unique model system, we delineated the functional consequences of chr8p loss and its impact on metastatic behavior and patient survival. We found that metastasis associated genes on chr8p act in concert to induce an aggressive and invasive phenotype characteristic for chr8p deleted tumors. The conjunction of engineered  chromosome-scale CNAs and genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 viability screenings served as a powerful tool for the discovery of novel synthetic lethal targets and vulnerabilities accompanying patient-specific copy number changes. Using this target identification strategy, we showed that chr8p deletion sensitizes tumor cells to targeting of the reactive oxygen sanitizing enzyme Nudix hydrolase 17 (NUDT17)."

Treatment with 30 and 100 \u03bcM PMQ more significantly inhibited cell growth and proliferation in Hep3B cells than in HepG2 and LO2 cells. PMQ induced Hep3B cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by significantly reducing CDK4, CDK6, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E1, Cyclin B1 and Bcl-2 expression and increasing Bax, CDK1 and cleaved PARP levels.

Notwithstanding the unique pathological feature of i-CHC, its molecular characteristics is not fully elucidated yet.",

            "Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a liver cancer of adolescents and young adults defined by fusion of the DNAJB1 heat shock protein and protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunit (DNAJB1-PRKACA). The resulting chimeric protein has increased kinase activity and is essential for FLC xenograft growth. However, the critical oncogenic pathways controlled by DNAJB1-PRKACA have not been defined. Here, we explored this question by studying patient-derived FLC models and engineered systems and analyzing patient samples. We show that the core function of DNAJB1-PRKACA is the direct phosphorylation and inactivation of the Salt-inducible kinases. This leads to deregulation of the CRTC2 co-activator and p300 acetyltransferase, resulting in transcriptional reprogramming and global increases in histone acetylation necessary for malignant growth. Our studies establish a central oncogenic mechanism of DNAJB1-PRKACA and suggest opportunities for therapeutic targeting of CRTC2/p300 in FLC. Notably, these findings link this signature fusion oncoprotein of a rare cancer type to more common cancer gene alterations involving the STK11 tumor suppressor and GNAS oncogene, which also function via SIK suppression."

            "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Hepatoblastoma (HB) are two liver cancers characterized by high gene deregulation, chromosomal rearrangements and typical mutations in genes related to the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin (Wnt) pathway. LHX2, a transcriptional factor member of the LIM homeobox gene family, has important functions in embryogenesis, liver development but also tumorigenesis. LHX2 is an oncogene in may solid tumors and leukemia but its role in liver cancer is unknown. To address this question we analyzed the expression of LHX2 in HCC and HB using various transcriptomic datasets and found a strong connection between LHX2 down-regulation and Wnt activation in these two liver cancers. In HB LHX2 downregulation correlated with multiple poor outcome parameters including higher patient age, intermediate- and high-risk tumors and patients\u2019 survival. A forced expression of LHX2 reduced the proliferation, the migration and the survival of hepatoma cells in vitro through the inactivation of MAPK/ERK and Wnt signalings. In vivo, LHX2 impeded the development of tumors in the chick embryo and repressed the Wnt pathway in Xenopus embryo. RNA-sequencing data and bioinformatic analyses confirmed the deregulation of many biological functions and molecular processes associated with cell migration, cell survival and liver carcinogenesis in LHX2-expressing hepatoma cells. At a mechanistic level, LHX2 induced the disassembling of beta-catenin and T-cell factor 4 and the expression of multiple inhibitors of Wnt (e.g. TLE/Groucho) and MAPK/ERK (e.g. DUSPs) pathways. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the tumor suppressive function of LHX2 in adult and pediatric liver cancers."

            "Large-scale chromosomal aberrations are prevalent in human cancer but their functional effects remain poorly understood. We describe the establishment of chromosome-engineered hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines using a dual guided CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing strategy. A mega base-sized region on chromosome 8p (chr8p) was heterozygously deleted mimicking a frequently observed copy number alteration (CNA) of solid tumors. Using this unique model system, we delineated the functional consequences of chr8p loss and its impact on metastatic behavior and patient survival. We found that metastasis associated genes on chr8p act in concert to induce an aggressive and invasive phenotype characteristic for chr8p deleted tumors. The conjunction of engineered  chromosome-scale CNAs and genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 viability screenings served as a powerful tool for the discovery of novel synthetic lethal targets and vulnerabilities accompanying patient-specific copy number changes. Using this target identification strategy, we showed that chr8p deletion sensitizes tumor cells to targeting of the reactive oxygen sanitizing enzyme Nudix hydrolase 17 (NUDT17)."

        "summary": [
            "Earlier studies linked sorafenib effectiveness to induction of ferroptosis. Herein we demonstrate sorafenib and mTKIs downregulate DDX5 in vitro and in vivo. To understand the effect of DDX5 downregulation, we compared TCGA-derived HCCs expressing low vs. high DDX5 focusing on ferroptosis-related genes. Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key ferroptosis regulator, was significantly overexpressed in DDX5LOW HCCs. Importantly, DDX5-knockdown (DDX5KD) HCC cell lines lacked lipid peroxidation by GPX4 inhibition, indicating DDX5 downregulation suppresses ferroptosis. RNAseq analyses comparing wild type vs. DDX5KD cells in the presence or absence of sorafenib, identified a unique set of genes repressed by DDX5 and upregulated by sorafenib. This set significantly overlaps genes from Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways, including NF-\u03baB inducing Kinase required for non-canonical NF-\u03baB activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of these pathways in combination with sorafenib reduced DDX5KD cell viability. Mechanistically, sorafenib-mediated NF-\u03baB activation induced NRF2 transcription, while DDX5KD extended NRF2 half/life by stabilizing p62/SQSTM1, leading to enhanced expression of GPX4 and ferroptosis escape. Conclusion: Sorafenib/mTKI-mediated DDX5 downregulation results in adaptive mTKI resistance by enhancing NRF2 expression, leading to ferroptosis escape. We propose inhibition of the pathways leading to NRF2 expression will enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of sorafenib/mTKIs."

            "Liver cancer claims over 800,000 human deaths each year. Liver cancer is notoriously refractory to conventional therapeutics. Further insight into the etiology carries promise for innovative diagnostics and therapeutics. Tumor progression is governed by interplay between tumor promoting genes and suppressor genes. BRD4, an acetyl-lysine binding protein, plays a critical role in development and human diseases. In many cancer types, BRD4 is overexpressed and promotes activation of a pro-tumor gene network. But the underlying mechanism for BRD4 overexpression remains elusive. As BRD4 has risen as a promising therapeutic target, to understand the mechanism regulating BRD4 protein level will shed insight into BRD4-targeting therapeutics. In this study, we find BRD4 protein level in liver cancer is significantly regulated by P53, the most frequently dysregulated tumor suppressor. We identify a strong negative correlation between protein levels of P53 and BRD4 in liver cancer. We then show P53 promotes BRD4 protein degradation. Mechanistically, P53 represses the transcription of USP1, a deubiquitinase, through P21-RB. We show USP1 is a deubiquitinase of BRD4, which increases its stability. We show the pro-tumor role of USP1 is partially mediated by BRD4 and the USP1-BRD4 axis upholds expression of a group of cancer-related genes. In summary, we identify a functional P53-P21-RB-USP1-BRD4 axis in liver cancer."

            "Hexokinases (HKs), a group of enzymes catalyzing the first step of glycolysis, have been shown to play important roles in liver metabolism and tumorigenesis. Our recent studies identified HKDC1 as a top candidate associated with liver cancer metastasis. We aimed to compare its cell type specificity with other HKs upregulated in liver cancer and investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying its involvement in liver cancer metastasis. We found that, compared to HK1 and HK2, the other two commonly upregulated HKs in liver cancer, HKDC1 was most strongly associated with the metastasis potential of tumors and organoids derived from two liver cancer mouse models we previously established. RNA in situ hybridization and single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed that HKDC1 was specifically upregulated in malignant cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patient tumors, whereas HK1 and HK2 were widespread across various tumor microenvironment lineages. An unbiased metabolomic profiling demonstrated that HKDC1 overexpression in HCC cells led to metabolic alterations distinct from those from HK1 and HK2 overexpression, with HKDC1 particularly impacting the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. HKDC1 was prometastatic in HCC orthotopic and tail vein injection mouse models. Molecularly, HKDC1 was induced by hypoxia and bound to glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 to stabilize \u03b2-catenin, leading to enhanced stemness of HCC cells. Overall, our findings underscore HKDC1 as a prometastatic HK specifically expressed in the malignant compartment of primary liver tumors, thereby providing a mechanistic basis for targeting this enzyme in advanced liver cancer."

The resulting chimeric protein has increased kinase activity and is essential for FLC xenograft growth. However, the critical oncogenic pathways controlled by DNAJB1-PRKACA have not been defined. Here, we explored this question by studying patient-derived FLC models and engineered systems and analyzing patient samples. We show that the core function of DNAJB1-PRKACA is the direct phosphorylation and inactivation of the Salt-inducible kinases. This leads to deregulation of the CRTC2 co-activator and p300 acetyltransferase, resulting in transcriptional reprogramming and global increases in histone acetylation necessary for malignant growth. Our studies establish a central oncogenic mechanism of DNAJB1-PRKACA and suggest opportunities for therapeutic targeting of CRTC2/p300 in FLC. Notably, these findings link this signature fusion oncoprotein of a rare cancer type to more common cancer gene alterations involving the STK11 tumor suppressor and GNAS oncogene, which also function via SIK suppression."

We identified an immunomodulatory fibroblast population, FAP+CCL19+CCL21+ CAFs, that expressed signatures of fibroblastic reticular cells and was associated with favorable prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These CAFs exhibited the potential to recruit NK cells and regulate tumor-associated macrophages, and appeared to be regulated by CXCL12+ endothelial cells in tumors through specific ligand-receptor interaction. Further, we uncovered clonal HBV integration events enriched in tumor cells, and trajectory analysis on tumor cells with clonal HBV integration events revealed that hepatoblast-like cells differentiated into a terminal state with high expression of an immune-resistance program. The intercellular crosstalks between CAFs and cancer cells, macrophages, and NK cells, combined with HBV-based lineage tracing, provide a better understanding for functional roles of CAFs in the HCC microenvironment, and the relationship between HBV integration and liver malignancies."

            "Liver cancer is a devastating disease characterized by its molecular complexity and the insidious behavior of liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs), which drive the metastasis and recurrence. However, the heterogeneity of molecular markers of LCSCs has hindered the development of effective methods to isolate them. This study introduced a pioneering approach to isolate and culture LCSCs from primary tumor tissues, leveraging mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) as a feeder cell to provide the niche in conjunction with using defined medium, which stands in stark contrast to traditional techniques, and promised to revolutionize our understanding of LCSCs. Total seventeen cell strains were directly isolated from 24 patients\u2019 tissues without sorting, seven of which could be maintained long-term culture as colony growth on MEFs, which is unique characteristics of stem cells. Cloned cells formed a round packed morphology on MEFs and could be cryopreserved and re-cultured. Even 10 of cloned cells could form xenografts of human liver cancers in immunodeficient mice, indicating high tumorigenicity. Thus, cloned cells could be designated as liver cancer stem cells. Our further investigation found that reported putative liver cancer stem cell markers were all expressed in cloned cells, and stemness of cancer stem cells could well maintained under our developed culture conditions when compared to those under traditional suspension conditions. Furthermore, our findings revealed a distinct molecular landscape within hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), pinpointing a C2 subtype with profound implications for personalized medicine and the development of targeted therapies. By illuminating the unique responses of this subtype to chemotherapeutic agents, our research not only advances the frontiers of liver cancer biology but also charts a course for more effective, patient-specific treatment strategies."

            "The rising incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a global problem. Several approved treatments, including immune therapy and multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are used for treatment, although the results are not optimum. There is an unmet need to develop highly effective chemotherapies for HCC. Targeting multiple pathways to attack cancer cells is beneficial. Cabozantinib is an orally available bioactive multikinase inhibitor and has a modest effect on HCC treatment. Silmitasertib is an orally bioavailable, potent CK2 inhibitor with a direct role in DNA damage repair and is in clinical trial for other cancers. In this study, we planned to repurpose these existing drugs on HCC treatment.  We observed stronger antiproliferative effect of these two combined drugs on HCC cells generated from different etiologies as compared to the single treatment. Global RNA-seq analyses revealed a decrease in the expression of G2/M cell cycle transition genes in HCC cells following combination treatment, suggesting G2 phase cell arrest. We observed G2/M cell cycle phase arrest in HCC cells upon combination treatment compared to the single-treated or vehicle-treated control cells. The downregulation of CCNA2 and CDC25C following combination therapy further supported the observation. Subsequent analyses demonstrated that combination treatment inhibited 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) phosphorylation, and increased Bim expression. Apoptosis of HCC cells were accompanied by increased poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and caspase-9 activation. Next, we observed that a combination therapy significantly delayed the progression of HCC xenograft growth as compared to vehicle control. Together, our results suggested combining cabozantinib and silmitasertib would be a promising treatment option for HCC."

However, mechanisms underlying metabolic reprogramming and how altered metabolism in turn enhances tumorigenicity are poorly understood.  Here, we report that arginine levels are elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) despite reduced expression of arginine synthesis genes, in murine and patient tumors.  Tumor cells accumulate high levels of arginine due to increased uptake and reduced arginine-to-polyamine conversion.  Importantly, the high levels of arginine promote tumor formation via further metabolic reprogramming, including changes in glucose, amino acid, nucleotide, and fatty acid metabolism.  Mechanistically, arginine binds RNA-binding motif protein 39 (RBM39) to control expression of metabolic genes.  RBM39-mediated upregulation of asparagine synthesis leads to enhanced arginine uptake, creating a positive feedback loop to sustain high arginine levels and oncogenic metabolism.

        "summary": [
            "Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a liver cancer of adolescents and young adults defined by fusion of the DNAJB1 heat shock protein and protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunit (DNAJB1-PRKACA). The resulting chimeric protein has increased kinase activity and is essential for FLC xenograft growth. However, the critical oncogenic pathways controlled by DNAJB1-PRKACA have not been defined. Here, we explored this question by studying patient-derived FLC models and engineered systems and analyzing patient samples. We show that the core function of DNAJB1-PRKACA is the direct phosphorylation and inactivation of the Salt-inducible kinases. This leads to deregulation of the CRTC2 co-activator and p300 acetyltransferase, resulting in transcriptional reprogramming and global increases in histone acetylation necessary for malignant growth. Our studies establish a central oncogenic mechanism of DNAJB1-PRKACA and suggest opportunities for therapeutic targeting of CRTC2/p300 in FLC. Notably, these findings link this signature fusion oncoprotein of a rare cancer type to more common cancer gene alterations involving the STK11 tumor suppressor and GNAS oncogene, which also function via SIK suppression."

A mega base-sized region on chromosome 8p (chr8p) was heterozygously deleted mimicking a frequently observed copy number alteration (CNA) of solid tumors. Using this unique model system, we delineated the functional consequences of chr8p loss and its impact on metastatic behavior and patient survival. We found that metastasis associated genes on chr8p act in concert to induce an aggressive and invasive phenotype characteristic for chr8p deleted tumors. The conjunction of engineered  chromosome-scale CNAs and genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 viability screenings served as a powerful tool for the discovery of novel synthetic lethal targets and vulnerabilities accompanying patient-specific copy number changes. Using this target identification strategy, we showed that chr8p deletion sensitizes tumor cells to targeting of the reactive oxygen sanitizing enzyme Nudix hydrolase 17 (NUDT17)."

Senescence induction may represent a strategy for cancer treatment, especially as a combination therapy. The posttranslational modification (PTM) of proteins critically influences many biological processes, including gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, tumor progression, and drug resistance. Herein, we newly discovered that the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Human antigen R (HuR), a hub in liver cancer, is SUMOylated in the tumor sections of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in contrast to the surrounding tissue, as well as in human cell line and mouse models of the disease. SUMOylation of HuR promotes major cancer hallmarks, namely proliferation and invasion, whereas the absence of HuR SUMOylation results in a senescent phenotype with dysfunctional mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mechanistically, SUMOylation induces a structural rearrangement of the RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that modulates HuR binding affinity to its target mRNAs further modifying the transcriptomic profile towards hepatic tumor progression."

            "Earlier studies linked sorafenib effectiveness to induction of ferroptosis. Herein we demonstrate sorafenib and mTKIs downregulate DDX5 in vitro and in vivo. To understand the effect of DDX5 downregulation, we compared TCGA-derived HCCs expressing low vs. high DDX5 focusing on ferroptosis-related genes. Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key ferroptosis regulator, was significantly overexpressed in DDX5LOW HCCs. Importantly, DDX5-knockdown (DDX5KD) HCC cell lines lacked lipid peroxidation by GPX4 inhibition, indicating DDX5 downregulation suppresses ferroptosis. RNAseq analyses comparing wild type vs. DDX5KD cells in the presence or absence of sorafenib, identified a unique set of genes repressed by DDX5 and upregulated by sorafenib. This set significantly overlaps genes from Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways, including NF-\u03baB inducing Kinase required for non-canonical NF-\u03baB activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of these pathways in combination with sorafenib reduced DDX5KD cell viability. Mechanistically, sorafenib-mediated NF-\u03baB activation induced NRF2 transcription, while DDX5KD extended NRF2 half/life by stabilizing p62/SQSTM1, leading to enhanced expression of GPX4 and ferroptosis escape. Conclusion: Sorafenib/mTKI-mediated DDX5 downregulation results in adaptive mTKI resistance by enhancing NRF2 expression, leading to ferroptosis escape. We propose inhibition of the pathways leading to NRF2 expression will enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of sorafenib/mTKIs."

However, mechanisms underlying metabolic reprogramming and how altered metabolism in turn enhances tumorigenicity are poorly understood.  Here, we report that arginine levels are elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) despite reduced expression of arginine synthesis genes, in murine and patient tumors.  Tumor cells accumulate high levels of arginine due to increased uptake and reduced arginine-to-polyamine conversion.  Importantly, the high levels of arginine promote tumor formation via further metabolic reprogramming, including changes in glucose, amino acid, nucleotide, and fatty acid metabolism.  Mechanistically, arginine binds RNA-binding motif protein 39 (RBM39) to control expression of metabolic genes.  RBM39-mediated upregulation of asparagine synthesis leads to enhanced arginine uptake, creating a positive feedback loop to sustain high arginine levels and oncogenic metabolism.  Thus, arginine is a second messenger-like molecule that reprograms metabolism to promote tumor growth."

            "The rising incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a global problem. Several approved treatments, including immune therapy and multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are used for treatment, although the results are not optimum. There is an unmet need to develop highly effective chemotherapies for HCC. Targeting multiple pathways to attack cancer cells is beneficial. Cabozantinib is an orally available bioactive multikinase inhibitor and has a modest effect on HCC treatment. Silmitasertib is an orally bioavailable, potent CK2 inhibitor with a direct role in DNA damage repair and is in clinical trial for other cancers. In this study, we planned to repurpose these existing drugs on HCC treatment.  We observed stronger antiproliferative effect of these two combined drugs on HCC cells generated from different etiologies as compared to the single treatment. Global RNA-seq analyses revealed a decrease in the expression of G2/M cell cycle transition genes in HCC cells following combination treatment, suggesting G2 phase cell arrest. We observed G2/M cell cycle phase arrest in HCC cells upon combination treatment compared to the single-treated or vehicle-treated control cells. The downregulation of CCNA2 and CDC25C following combination therapy further supported the observation. Subsequent analyses demonstrated that combination treatment inhibited 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) phosphorylation, and increased Bim expression. Apoptosis of HCC cells were accompanied by increased poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and caspase-9 activation. Next, we observed that a combination therapy significantly delayed the progression of HCC xenograft growth as compared to vehicle control. Together, our results suggested combining cabozantinib and silmitasertib would be a promising treatment option for HCC."

Here, we demonstrated that B cells are an important regulator in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) microenvironments. B cells displayed distinct developmental trajectories in HCC and CRLM. Single-cell analysis revealed that IgG+ plasma cells preferentially accumulated in HCC while IgA+ plasma cells were preferentially enriched in CRLM. Mechanistically, IgG+ plasma cells in HCC were recruited by tumor-associated macrophages via the CXCR3-CXCL10 axis, whereas IgA+ plasma cells in CRLM were recruited by metastatic tumor cells via CCR10-CCL28 signaling. Functionally, IgG+ plasma cells preferentially promoted pro-tumorigenic macrophages formation in HCC, and IgA+ plasma cells preferentially induced granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells activation in CRLM. Clinically, increased infiltration of IgG+ plasma cells and macrophages in HCC was correlated to worse survival, while increased intratumoral IgA+ plasma cells and neutrophils in CRLM indicated poor prognosis. Taken together, this study demonstrated plasma and myeloid cell-mediated immunosuppression in HCC and CRLM, suggesting that selectively modulating primary or secondary tumor-related immunosuppressive regulatory networks might reprogram the microenvironment and provide an immunotherapeutic strategy for treating liver cancer."

            "Hexokinases (HKs), a group of enzymes catalyzing the first step of glycolysis, have been shown to play important roles in liver metabolism and tumorigenesis. Our recent studies identified HKDC1 as a top candidate associated with liver cancer metastasis. We aimed to compare its cell type specificity with other HKs upregulated in liver cancer and investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying its involvement in liver cancer metastasis. We found that, compared to HK1 and HK2, the other two commonly upregulated HKs in liver cancer, HKDC1 was most strongly associated with the metastasis potential of tumors and organoids derived from two liver cancer mouse models we previously established. RNA in situ hybridization and single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed that HKDC1 was specifically upregulated in malignant cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patient tumors, whereas HK1 and HK2 were widespread across various tumor microenvironment lineages. An unbiased metabolomic profiling demonstrated that HKDC1 overexpression in HCC cells led to metabolic alterations distinct from those from HK1 and HK2 overexpression, with HKDC1 particularly impacting the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. HKDC1 was prometastatic in HCC orthotopic and tail vein injection mouse models. Molecularly, HKDC1 was induced by hypoxia and bound to glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 to stabilize \u03b2-catenin, leading to enhanced stemness of HCC cells. Overall, our findings underscore HKDC1 as a prometastatic HK specifically expressed in the malignant compartment of primary liver tumors, thereby providing a mechanistic basis for targeting this enzyme in advanced liver cancer."

            "Fatty liver is a condition of excessive triglyceride accumulation in hepatocytes. Additionally, hepatocytes showed a high degree of fat droplet accumulation during excessive alcohol consumption and metabolic syndrome. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in fat droplet formation remain unknown. This study used an in vitro fatty liver formation model of the human liver cancer cell line HepG2 to comprehensively search for fat droplet formation-related genes whose expression changes during fat droplet formation. Microarray analysis with extracted total RNA determined the genes that are involved in fat droplet formation and confirmed their expression by real-time polymerase chain reaction after culturing HepG2 cells in a culture medium containing 0, 50, 200, and 500 \u03bcM of oleic acid for 24 h. The results revealed 142 genes demonstrating increased expressions by >2.0 fold with oleic acid treatment and 426 genes demonstrating decreased expressions. Perilipin 2 (PLIN2) was estimated as the gene most closely associated with fatty liver. Lipid droplet formation in HepG2 upregulated PLIN2 in an oleic acid-treated concentration-dependent manner. These results indicate the involvement of genes in oleate treatment-induced lipid droplet formation in HepG2, particularly PLIN2 may play an important role."

            "Hexokinases (HKs), a group of enzymes catalyzing the first step of glycolysis, have been shown to play important roles in liver metabolism and tumorigenesis. Our recent studies identified HKDC1 as a top candidate associated with liver cancer metastasis. We aimed to compare its cell type specificity with other HKs upregulated in liver cancer and investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying its involvement in liver cancer metastasis. We found that, compared to HK1 and HK2, the other two commonly upregulated HKs in liver cancer, HKDC1 was most strongly associated with the metastasis potential of tumors and organoids derived from two liver cancer mouse models we previously established. RNA in situ hybridization and single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed that HKDC1 was specifically upregulated in malignant cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patient tumors, whereas HK1 and HK2 were widespread across various tumor microenvironment lineages. An unbiased metabolomic profiling demonstrated that HKDC1 overexpression in HCC cells led to metabolic alterations distinct from those from HK1 and HK2 overexpression, with HKDC1 particularly impacting the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. HKDC1 was prometastatic in HCC orthotopic and tail vein injection mouse models. Molecularly, HKDC1 was induced by hypoxia and bound to glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 to stabilize \u03b2-catenin, leading to enhanced stemness of HCC cells. Overall, our findings underscore HKDC1 as a prometastatic HK specifically expressed in the malignant compartment of primary liver tumors, thereby providing a mechanistic basis for targeting this enzyme in advanced liver cancer."

        "summary": [
            "Liver cancer claims over 800,000 human deaths each year. Liver cancer is notoriously refractory to conventional therapeutics. Further insight into the etiology carries promise for innovative diagnostics and therapeutics. Tumor progression is governed by interplay between tumor promoting genes and suppressor genes. BRD4, an acetyl-lysine binding protein, plays a critical role in development and human diseases. In many cancer types, BRD4 is overexpressed and promotes activation of a pro-tumor gene network. But the underlying mechanism for BRD4 overexpression remains elusive. As BRD4 has risen as a promising therapeutic target, to understand the mechanism regulating BRD4 protein level will shed insight into BRD4-targeting therapeutics. In this study, we find BRD4 protein level in liver cancer is significantly regulated by P53, the most frequently dysregulated tumor suppressor. We identify a strong negative correlation between protein levels of P53 and BRD4 in liver cancer. We then show P53 promotes BRD4 protein degradation. Mechanistically, P53 represses the transcription of USP1, a deubiquitinase, through P21-RB. We show USP1 is a deubiquitinase of BRD4, which increases its stability. We show the pro-tumor role of USP1 is partially mediated by BRD4 and the USP1-BRD4 axis upholds expression of a group of cancer-related genes. In summary, we identify a functional P53-P21-RB-USP1-BRD4 axis in liver cancer."

We identified an immunomodulatory fibroblast population, FAP+CCL19+CCL21+ CAFs, that expressed signatures of fibroblastic reticular cells and was associated with favorable prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These CAFs exhibited the potential to recruit NK cells and regulate tumor-associated macrophages, and appeared to be regulated by CXCL12+ endothelial cells in tumors through specific ligand-receptor interaction. Further, we uncovered clonal HBV integration events enriched in tumor cells, and trajectory analysis on tumor cells with clonal HBV integration events revealed that hepatoblast-like cells differentiated into a terminal state with high expression of an immune-resistance program. The intercellular crosstalks between CAFs and cancer cells, macrophages, and NK cells, combined with HBV-based lineage tracing, provide a better understanding for functional roles of CAFs in the HCC microenvironment, and the relationship between HBV integration and liver malignancies."

Here, we demonstrated that B cells are an important regulator in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) microenvironments. B cells displayed distinct developmental trajectories in HCC and CRLM. Single-cell analysis revealed that IgG+ plasma cells preferentially accumulated in HCC while IgA+ plasma cells were preferentially enriched in CRLM. Mechanistically, IgG+ plasma cells in HCC were recruited by tumor-associated macrophages via the CXCR3-CXCL10 axis, whereas IgA+ plasma cells in CRLM were recruited by metastatic tumor cells via CCR10-CCL28 signaling. Functionally, IgG+ plasma cells preferentially promoted pro-tumorigenic macrophages formation in HCC, and IgA+ plasma cells preferentially induced granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells activation in CRLM. Clinically, increased infiltration of IgG+ plasma cells and macrophages in HCC was correlated to worse survival, while increased intratumoral IgA+ plasma cells and neutrophils in CRLM indicated poor prognosis. Taken together, this study demonstrated plasma and myeloid cell-mediated immunosuppression in HCC and CRLM, suggesting that selectively modulating primary or secondary tumor-related immunosuppressive regulatory networks might reprogram the microenvironment and provide an immunotherapeutic strategy for treating liver cancer."

            "The mechanisms underlying cancer metastasis remain poorly understood. Here, we report that TFAM deficiency rapidly and stably induced spontaneous lung metastasis in mice with liver cancer. Interestingly, unexpected polymerization of nuclear actin was observed in TFAM-knockdown HCC cells when cytoskeleton was examined. Polymerization of nuclear actin is causally linked to the high-metastatic ability of HCC cells by modulating chromatin accessibility and coordinating the expression of genes associated with extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis and cell migration. Mechanistically, TFAM deficiency blocked the TCA cycle and increased the intracellular malonyl-CoA levels. Malonylation of mDia2, which drives actin assembly, promotes its nuclear translocation. Importantly, inhibition of malonyl-CoA production or nuclear actin polymerization significantly impeded the spread of HCC cells in mice. Moreover, TFAM was significantly downregulated in metastatic HCC tissues and was associated with overall survival and time to tumor recurrence of HCC patients. Taken together, our study connects mitochondria to the metastasis of human cancer via uncovered mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde signaling, indicating that TFAM may serve as an effective target to block HCC metastasis."

Additionally, hepatocytes showed a high degree of fat droplet accumulation during excessive alcohol consumption and metabolic syndrome. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in fat droplet formation remain unknown. This study used an in vitro fatty liver formation model of the human liver cancer cell line HepG2 to comprehensively search for fat droplet formation-related genes whose expression changes during fat droplet formation. Microarray analysis with extracted total RNA determined the genes that are involved in fat droplet formation and confirmed their expression by real-time polymerase chain reaction after culturing HepG2 cells in a culture medium containing 0, 50, 200, and 500 \u03bcM of oleic acid for 24 h. The results revealed 142 genes demonstrating increased expressions by >2.0 fold with oleic acid treatment and 426 genes demonstrating decreased expressions. Perilipin 2 (PLIN2) was estimated as the gene most closely associated with fatty liver. Lipid droplet formation in HepG2 upregulated PLIN2 in an oleic acid-treated concentration-dependent manner. These results indicate the involvement of genes in oleate treatment-induced lipid droplet formation in HepG2, particularly PLIN2 may play an important role."

            "The protein diversity of mammalian cells is determined by arrays of isoforms from genes. Protein mutation is essential in species evolution and cancer development. Accurate Long-read transcriptome sequencing at single-cell level is required to decipher the spectrum of protein expressions in mammalian organisms. In this report, we developed a synthetic long-read single-cell sequencing technology based on LOOPseq technique. We applied this technology to analyze 447 transcriptomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and benign liver from an individual. Through Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) analysis, we identified a panel of mutation mRNA isoforms highly specific to HCC cells. The evolution pathways that led to the hyper-mutation clusters in single human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules were identified. Novel fusion transcripts were detected. The combination of gene expressions, fusion gene transcripts, and mutation gene expressions significantly improved the classification of liver cancer cells versus benign hepatocytes. In conclusion, LOOPseq single-cell technology may hold promise to provide a new level of precision analysis on the mammalian transcriptome."

            "The mechanisms underlying cancer metastasis remain poorly understood. Here, we report that TFAM deficiency rapidly and stably induced spontaneous lung metastasis in mice with liver cancer. Interestingly, unexpected polymerization of nuclear actin was observed in TFAM-knockdown HCC cells when cytoskeleton was examined. Polymerization of nuclear actin is causally linked to the high-metastatic ability of HCC cells by modulating chromatin accessibility and coordinating the expression of genes associated with extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis and cell migration. Mechanistically, TFAM deficiency blocked the TCA cycle and increased the intracellular malonyl-CoA levels. Malonylation of mDia2, which drives actin assembly, promotes its nuclear translocation. Importantly, inhibition of malonyl-CoA production or nuclear actin polymerization significantly impeded the spread of HCC cells in mice. Moreover, TFAM was significantly downregulated in metastatic HCC tissues and was associated with overall survival and time to tumor recurrence of HCC patients. Taken together, our study connects mitochondria to the metastasis of human cancer via uncovered mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde signaling, indicating that TFAM may serve as an effective target to block HCC metastasis."

Here, we demonstrated that B cells are an important regulator in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) microenvironments. B cells displayed distinct developmental trajectories in HCC and CRLM. Single-cell analysis revealed that IgG+ plasma cells preferentially accumulated in HCC while IgA+ plasma cells were preferentially enriched in CRLM. Mechanistically, IgG+ plasma cells in HCC were recruited by tumor-associated macrophages via the CXCR3-CXCL10 axis, whereas IgA+ plasma cells in CRLM were recruited by metastatic tumor cells via CCR10-CCL28 signaling. Functionally, IgG+ plasma cells preferentially promoted pro-tumorigenic macrophages formation in HCC, and IgA+ plasma cells preferentially induced granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells activation in CRLM. Clinically, increased infiltration of IgG+ plasma cells and macrophages in HCC was correlated to worse survival, while increased intratumoral IgA+ plasma cells and neutrophils in CRLM indicated poor prognosis. Taken together, this study demonstrated plasma and myeloid cell-mediated immunosuppression in HCC and CRLM, suggesting that selectively modulating primary or secondary tumor-related immunosuppressive regulatory networks might reprogram the microenvironment and provide an immunotherapeutic strategy for treating liver cancer."

        "summary": [
            "Earlier studies linked sorafenib effectiveness to induction of ferroptosis. Herein we demonstrate sorafenib and mTKIs downregulate DDX5 in vitro and in vivo. To understand the effect of DDX5 downregulation, we compared TCGA-derived HCCs expressing low vs. high DDX5 focusing on ferroptosis-related genes. Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key ferroptosis regulator, was significantly overexpressed in DDX5LOW HCCs. Importantly, DDX5-knockdown (DDX5KD) HCC cell lines lacked lipid peroxidation by GPX4 inhibition, indicating DDX5 downregulation suppresses ferroptosis. RNAseq analyses comparing wild type vs. DDX5KD cells in the presence or absence of sorafenib, identified a unique set of genes repressed by DDX5 and upregulated by sorafenib. This set significantly overlaps genes from Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways, including NF-\u03baB inducing Kinase required for non-canonical NF-\u03baB activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of these pathways in combination with sorafenib reduced DDX5KD cell viability. Mechanistically, sorafenib-mediated NF-\u03baB activation induced NRF2 transcription, while DDX5KD extended NRF2 half/life by stabilizing p62/SQSTM1, leading to enhanced expression of GPX4 and ferroptosis escape. Conclusion: Sorafenib/mTKI-mediated DDX5 downregulation results in adaptive mTKI resistance by enhancing NRF2 expression, leading to ferroptosis escape. We propose inhibition of the pathways leading to NRF2 expression will enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of sorafenib/mTKIs."

We describe the establishment of chromosome-engineered hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines using a dual guided CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing strategy. A mega base-sized region on chromosome 8p (chr8p) was heterozygously deleted mimicking a frequently observed copy number alteration (CNA) of solid tumors. Using this unique model system, we delineated the functional consequences of chr8p loss and its impact on metastatic behavior and patient survival. We found that metastasis associated genes on chr8p act in concert to induce an aggressive and invasive phenotype characteristic for chr8p deleted tumors. The conjunction of engineered  chromosome-scale CNAs and genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 viability screenings served as a powerful tool for the discovery of novel synthetic lethal targets and vulnerabilities accompanying patient-specific copy number changes. Using this target identification strategy, we showed that chr8p deletion sensitizes tumor cells to targeting of the reactive oxygen sanitizing enzyme Nudix hydrolase 17 (NUDT17)."

Here, we demonstrated that B cells are an important regulator in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) microenvironments. B cells displayed distinct developmental trajectories in HCC and CRLM. Single-cell analysis revealed that IgG+ plasma cells preferentially accumulated in HCC while IgA+ plasma cells were preferentially enriched in CRLM. Mechanistically, IgG+ plasma cells in HCC were recruited by tumor-associated macrophages via the CXCR3-CXCL10 axis, whereas IgA+ plasma cells in CRLM were recruited by metastatic tumor cells via CCR10-CCL28 signaling. Functionally, IgG+ plasma cells preferentially promoted pro-tumorigenic macrophages formation in HCC, and IgA+ plasma cells preferentially induced granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells activation in CRLM. Clinically, increased infiltration of IgG+ plasma cells and macrophages in HCC was correlated to worse survival, while increased intratumoral IgA+ plasma cells and neutrophils in CRLM indicated poor prognosis. Taken together, this study demonstrated plasma and myeloid cell-mediated immunosuppression in HCC and CRLM, suggesting that selectively modulating primary or secondary tumor-related immunosuppressive regulatory networks might reprogram the microenvironment and provide an immunotherapeutic strategy for treating liver cancer."

Notwithstanding the unique pathological feature of i-CHC, its molecular characteristics is not fully elucidated yet.",

        "summary": [
            "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Hepatoblastoma (HB) are two liver cancers characterized by high gene deregulation, chromosomal rearrangements and typical mutations in genes related to the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin (Wnt) pathway. LHX2, a transcriptional factor member of the LIM homeobox gene family, has important functions in embryogenesis, liver development but also tumorigenesis. LHX2 is an oncogene in may solid tumors and leukemia but its role in liver cancer is unknown. To address this question we analyzed the expression of LHX2 in HCC and HB using various transcriptomic datasets and found a strong connection between LHX2 down-regulation and Wnt activation in these two liver cancers. In HB LHX2 downregulation correlated with multiple poor outcome parameters including higher patient age, intermediate- and high-risk tumors and patients\u2019 survival. A forced expression of LHX2 reduced the proliferation, the migration and the survival of hepatoma cells in vitro through the inactivation of MAPK/ERK and Wnt signalings. In vivo, LHX2 impeded the development of tumors in the chick embryo and repressed the Wnt pathway in Xenopus embryo. RNA-sequencing data and bioinformatic analyses confirmed the deregulation of many biological functions and molecular processes associated with cell migration, cell survival and liver carcinogenesis in LHX2-expressing hepatoma cells. At a mechanistic level, LHX2 induced the disassembling of beta-catenin and T-cell factor 4 and the expression of multiple inhibitors of Wnt (e.g. TLE/Groucho) and MAPK/ERK (e.g. DUSPs) pathways. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the tumor suppressive function of LHX2 in adult and pediatric liver cancers."

        "summary": [
            "Liver cancer claims over 800,000 human deaths each year. Liver cancer is notoriously refractory to conventional therapeutics. Further insight into the etiology carries promise for innovative diagnostics and therapeutics. Tumor progression is governed by interplay between tumor promoting genes and suppressor genes. BRD4, an acetyl-lysine binding protein, plays a critical role in development and human diseases. In many cancer types, BRD4 is overexpressed and promotes activation of a pro-tumor gene network. But the underlying mechanism for BRD4 overexpression remains elusive. As BRD4 has risen as a promising therapeutic target, to understand the mechanism regulating BRD4 protein level will shed insight into BRD4-targeting therapeutics. In this study, we find BRD4 protein level in liver cancer is significantly regulated by P53, the most frequently dysregulated tumor suppressor. We identify a strong negative correlation between protein levels of P53 and BRD4 in liver cancer. We then show P53 promotes BRD4 protein degradation. Mechanistically, P53 represses the transcription of USP1, a deubiquitinase, through P21-RB. We show USP1 is a deubiquitinase of BRD4, which increases its stability. We show the pro-tumor role of USP1 is partially mediated by BRD4 and the USP1-BRD4 axis upholds expression of a group of cancer-related genes. In summary, we identify a functional P53-P21-RB-USP1-BRD4 axis in liver cancer."

Uncontrolled transcriptional output of YAP/TAZ can lead to rapid induction of aggressive tumor growth. AP-1 is a dimeric basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor complex with JUN and FOS proteins being the most abundant members of this family. Unlike FOS, JUN can also form homodimers, but in the cell, JUN presumably preferentially forms heterodimers with members of the FOS family, which act as potent transcriptional activators. Previous studies identified substantial co-occupancy of YAP/TAZ and AP-1 at genomic sites, and they demonstrated that JUN/FOS heterodimers cooperate with the YAP/TAZ and TEAD transcription factors to drive YAP/TAZ target gene expression. Here, we now elucidate a negative feedback mechanism in which high YAP activity is restrained by the recruitment of homodimeric JUN::JUN/NCOR1 repressor complexes and show that this noncanonical JUN function is part of a tumor suppressor mechanism in the liver."

            "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Hepatoblastoma (HB) are two liver cancers characterized by high gene deregulation, chromosomal rearrangements and typical mutations in genes related to the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin (Wnt) pathway. LHX2, a transcriptional factor member of the LIM homeobox gene family, has important functions in embryogenesis, liver development but also tumorigenesis. LHX2 is an oncogene in may solid tumors and leukemia but its role in liver cancer is unknown. To address this question we analyzed the expression of LHX2 in HCC and HB using various transcriptomic datasets and found a strong connection between LHX2 down-regulation and Wnt activation in these two liver cancers. In HB LHX2 downregulation correlated with multiple poor outcome parameters including higher patient age, intermediate- and high-risk tumors and patients\u2019 survival. A forced expression of LHX2 reduced the proliferation, the migration and the survival of hepatoma cells in vitro through the inactivation of MAPK/ERK and Wnt signalings. In vivo, LHX2 impeded the development of tumors in the chick embryo and repressed the Wnt pathway in Xenopus embryo. RNA-sequencing data and bioinformatic analyses confirmed the deregulation of many biological functions and molecular processes associated with cell migration, cell survival and liver carcinogenesis in LHX2-expressing hepatoma cells. At a mechanistic level, LHX2 induced the disassembling of beta-catenin and T-cell factor 4 and the expression of multiple inhibitors of Wnt (e.g. TLE/Groucho) and MAPK/ERK (e.g. DUSPs) pathways. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the tumor suppressive function of LHX2 in adult and pediatric liver cancers."

            "The clinical management of liver cancer is challenged by the reduced availability of drugs targeting key signaling pathways and their modest benefits to patients. Senescence induction may represent a strategy for cancer treatment, especially as a combination therapy. The posttranslational modification (PTM) of proteins critically influences many biological processes, including gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, tumor progression, and drug resistance. Herein, we newly discovered that the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Human antigen R (HuR), a hub in liver cancer, is SUMOylated in the tumor sections of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in contrast to the surrounding tissue, as well as in human cell line and mouse models of the disease. SUMOylation of HuR promotes major cancer hallmarks, namely proliferation and invasion, whereas the absence of HuR SUMOylation results in a senescent phenotype with dysfunctional mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mechanistically, SUMOylation induces a structural rearrangement of the RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that modulates HuR binding affinity to its target mRNAs further modifying the transcriptomic profile towards hepatic tumor progression."

We describe the establishment of chromosome-engineered hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines using a dual guided CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing strategy. A mega base-sized region on chromosome 8p (chr8p) was heterozygously deleted mimicking a frequently observed copy number alteration (CNA) of solid tumors. Using this unique model system, we delineated the functional consequences of chr8p loss and its impact on metastatic behavior and patient survival. We found that metastasis associated genes on chr8p act in concert to induce an aggressive and invasive phenotype characteristic for chr8p deleted tumors. The conjunction of engineered  chromosome-scale CNAs and genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 viability screenings served as a powerful tool for the discovery of novel synthetic lethal targets and vulnerabilities accompanying patient-specific copy number changes. Using this target identification strategy, we showed that chr8p deletion sensitizes tumor cells to targeting of the reactive oxygen sanitizing enzyme Nudix hydrolase 17 (NUDT17)."

        "summary": [
            "Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a liver cancer of adolescents and young adults defined by fusion of the DNAJB1 heat shock protein and protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunit (DNAJB1-PRKACA). The resulting chimeric protein has increased kinase activity and is essential for FLC xenograft growth. However, the critical oncogenic pathways controlled by DNAJB1-PRKACA have not been defined. Here, we explored this question by studying patient-derived FLC models and engineered systems and analyzing patient samples. We show that the core function of DNAJB1-PRKACA is the direct phosphorylation and inactivation of the Salt-inducible kinases. This leads to deregulation of the CRTC2 co-activator and p300 acetyltransferase, resulting in transcriptional reprogramming and global increases in histone acetylation necessary for malignant growth. Our studies establish a central oncogenic mechanism of DNAJB1-PRKACA and suggest opportunities for therapeutic targeting of CRTC2/p300 in FLC. Notably, these findings link this signature fusion oncoprotein of a rare cancer type to more common cancer gene alterations involving the STK11 tumor suppressor and GNAS oncogene, which also function via SIK suppression."

            "Hexokinases (HKs), a group of enzymes catalyzing the first step of glycolysis, have been shown to play important roles in liver metabolism and tumorigenesis. Our recent studies identified HKDC1 as a top candidate associated with liver cancer metastasis. We aimed to compare its cell type specificity with other HKs upregulated in liver cancer and investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying its involvement in liver cancer metastasis. We found that, compared to HK1 and HK2, the other two commonly upregulated HKs in liver cancer, HKDC1 was most strongly associated with the metastasis potential of tumors and organoids derived from two liver cancer mouse models we previously established. RNA in situ hybridization and single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed that HKDC1 was specifically upregulated in malignant cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patient tumors, whereas HK1 and HK2 were widespread across various tumor microenvironment lineages. An unbiased metabolomic profiling demonstrated that HKDC1 overexpression in HCC cells led to metabolic alterations distinct from those from HK1 and HK2 overexpression, with HKDC1 particularly impacting the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. HKDC1 was prometastatic in HCC orthotopic and tail vein injection mouse models. Molecularly, HKDC1 was induced by hypoxia and bound to glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 to stabilize \u03b2-catenin, leading to enhanced stemness of HCC cells. Overall, our findings underscore HKDC1 as a prometastatic HK specifically expressed in the malignant compartment of primary liver tumors, thereby providing a mechanistic basis for targeting this enzyme in advanced liver cancer."

        "summary": [
            "Earlier studies linked sorafenib effectiveness to induction of ferroptosis. Herein we demonstrate sorafenib and mTKIs downregulate DDX5 in vitro and in vivo. To understand the effect of DDX5 downregulation, we compared TCGA-derived HCCs expressing low vs. high DDX5 focusing on ferroptosis-related genes. Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key ferroptosis regulator, was significantly overexpressed in DDX5LOW HCCs. Importantly, DDX5-knockdown (DDX5KD) HCC cell lines lacked lipid peroxidation by GPX4 inhibition, indicating DDX5 downregulation suppresses ferroptosis. RNAseq analyses comparing wild type vs. DDX5KD cells in the presence or absence of sorafenib, identified a unique set of genes repressed by DDX5 and upregulated by sorafenib. This set significantly overlaps genes from Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways, including NF-\u03baB inducing Kinase required for non-canonical NF-\u03baB activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of these pathways in combination with sorafenib reduced DDX5KD cell viability. Mechanistically, sorafenib-mediated NF-\u03baB activation induced NRF2 transcription, while DDX5KD extended NRF2 half/life by stabilizing p62/SQSTM1, leading to enhanced expression of GPX4 and ferroptosis escape. Conclusion: Sorafenib/mTKI-mediated DDX5 downregulation results in adaptive mTKI resistance by enhancing NRF2 expression, leading to ferroptosis escape. We propose inhibition of the pathways leading to NRF2 expression will enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of sorafenib/mTKIs."

Here, we demonstrated that B cells are an important regulator in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) microenvironments. B cells displayed distinct developmental trajectories in HCC and CRLM. Single-cell analysis revealed that IgG+ plasma cells preferentially accumulated in HCC while IgA+ plasma cells were preferentially enriched in CRLM. Mechanistically, IgG+ plasma cells in HCC were recruited by tumor-associated macrophages via the CXCR3-CXCL10 axis, whereas IgA+ plasma cells in CRLM were recruited by metastatic tumor cells via CCR10-CCL28 signaling. Functionally, IgG+ plasma cells preferentially promoted pro-tumorigenic macrophages formation in HCC, and IgA+ plasma cells preferentially induced granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells activation in CRLM. Clinically, increased infiltration of IgG+ plasma cells and macrophages in HCC was correlated to worse survival, while increased intratumoral IgA+ plasma cells and neutrophils in CRLM indicated poor prognosis. Taken together, this study demonstrated plasma and myeloid cell-mediated immunosuppression in HCC and CRLM, suggesting that selectively modulating primary or secondary tumor-related immunosuppressive regulatory networks might reprogram the microenvironment and provide an immunotherapeutic strategy for treating liver cancer."

We identified an immunomodulatory fibroblast population, FAP+CCL19+CCL21+ CAFs, that expressed signatures of fibroblastic reticular cells and was associated with favorable prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These CAFs exhibited the potential to recruit NK cells and regulate tumor-associated macrophages, and appeared to be regulated by CXCL12+ endothelial cells in tumors through specific ligand-receptor interaction. Further, we uncovered clonal HBV integration events enriched in tumor cells, and trajectory analysis on tumor cells with clonal HBV integration events revealed that hepatoblast-like cells differentiated into a terminal state with high expression of an immune-resistance program. The intercellular crosstalks between CAFs and cancer cells, macrophages, and NK cells, combined with HBV-based lineage tracing, provide a better understanding for functional roles of CAFs in the HCC microenvironment, and the relationship between HBV integration and liver malignancies."

Notwithstanding the unique pathological feature of i-CHC, its molecular characteristics is not fully elucidated yet.",

Noticeably, we found that i-CHC had DNA-copy number loss and concomitant transcriptional suppression of METTL16, which may contribute to the aggressive progression of i-CHC via Notch activation.",

            "The rising incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a global problem. Several approved treatments, including immune therapy and multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are used for treatment, although the results are not optimum. There is an unmet need to develop highly effective chemotherapies for HCC. Targeting multiple pathways to attack cancer cells is beneficial. Cabozantinib is an orally available bioactive multikinase inhibitor and has a modest effect on HCC treatment. Silmitasertib is an orally bioavailable, potent CK2 inhibitor with a direct role in DNA damage repair and is in clinical trial for other cancers. In this study, we planned to repurpose these existing drugs on HCC treatment.  We observed stronger antiproliferative effect of these two combined drugs on HCC cells generated from different etiologies as compared to the single treatment. Global RNA-seq analyses revealed a decrease in the expression of G2/M cell cycle transition genes in HCC cells following combination treatment, suggesting G2 phase cell arrest. We observed G2/M cell cycle phase arrest in HCC cells upon combination treatment compared to the single-treated or vehicle-treated control cells. The downregulation of CCNA2 and CDC25C following combination therapy further supported the observation. Subsequent analyses demonstrated that combination treatment inhibited 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) phosphorylation, and increased Bim expression. Apoptosis of HCC cells were accompanied by increased poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and caspase-9 activation. Next, we observed that a combination therapy significantly delayed the progression of HCC xenograft growth as compared to vehicle control. Together, our results suggested combining cabozantinib and silmitasertib would be a promising treatment option for HCC."

Accurate Long-read transcriptome sequencing at single-cell level is required to decipher the spectrum of protein expressions in mammalian organisms. In this report, we developed a synthetic long-read single-cell sequencing technology based on LOOPseq technique. We applied this technology to analyze 447 transcriptomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and benign liver from an individual. Through Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) analysis, we identified a panel of mutation mRNA isoforms highly specific to HCC cells. The evolution pathways that led to the hyper-mutation clusters in single human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules were identified. Novel fusion transcripts were detected. The combination of gene expressions, fusion gene transcripts, and mutation gene expressions significantly improved the classification of liver cancer cells versus benign hepatocytes. In conclusion, LOOPseq single-cell technology may hold promise to provide a new level of precision analysis on the mammalian transcriptome."

            "Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer.  However, mechanisms underlying metabolic reprogramming and how altered metabolism in turn enhances tumorigenicity are poorly understood.  Here, we report that arginine levels are elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) despite reduced expression of arginine synthesis genes, in murine and patient tumors.  Tumor cells accumulate high levels of arginine due to increased uptake and reduced arginine-to-polyamine conversion.  Importantly, the high levels of arginine promote tumor formation via further metabolic reprogramming, including changes in glucose, amino acid, nucleotide, and fatty acid metabolism.  Mechanistically, arginine binds RNA-binding motif protein 39 (RBM39) to control expression of metabolic genes.  RBM39-mediated upregulation of asparagine synthesis leads to enhanced arginine uptake, creating a positive feedback loop to sustain high arginine levels and oncogenic metabolism.  Thus, arginine is a second messenger-like molecule that reprograms metabolism to promote tumor growth."

            "Liver cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies with an annual death of over 830,000 cases. Although targeted therapeutic drugs have achieved certain clinical efficacy, only sorafenib and lenvatinib are currently marketed as first-line targeted drugs to treat patients with advanced liver cancer. Therefore, developing more drugs are urgently needed. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent programmed cell death (PCD) distinct from known PCDs including apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. Targeting ferroptosis is recognized as a promising potential therapeutic modality for liver cancer. Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is an important ferroptosis inducer and targeting ATF3 offers a potential means to cancer therapy. In the present study, we reported for the first time a sophoridine derivative 6j with promising anti-liver cancer effects in vitro and in vivo. Compound 6j could induce liver cancer cells ferroptosis by promoting the accumulation of intracellular Fe2+, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and MDA. Inhibition of ferroptosis by ferrostatin-1 alleviated 6j induced accumulation of Fe2+, ROS, and MDA and restored cell viability. Further study revealed that compound 6j upregulated the expression of ATF3 via ER stress and knockdown of ATF3 by RNA interference attenuated 6j induced ferroptosis and cell proliferation inhibition. This study would provide new insights for the design of ferroptosis inducers and the development of anti-liver cancer drugs."

Using this unique model system, we delineated the functional consequences of chr8p loss and its impact on metastatic behavior and patient survival. We found that metastasis associated genes on chr8p act in concert to induce an aggressive and invasive phenotype characteristic for chr8p deleted tumors. The conjunction of engineered  chromosome-scale CNAs and genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 viability screenings served as a powerful tool for the discovery of novel synthetic lethal targets and vulnerabilities accompanying patient-specific copy number changes. Using this target identification strategy, we showed that chr8p deletion sensitizes tumor cells to targeting of the reactive oxygen sanitizing enzyme Nudix hydrolase 17 (NUDT17)."

            "The mechanisms underlying cancer metastasis remain poorly understood. Here, we report that TFAM deficiency rapidly and stably induced spontaneous lung metastasis in mice with liver cancer. Interestingly, unexpected polymerization of nuclear actin was observed in TFAM-knockdown HCC cells when cytoskeleton was examined. Polymerization of nuclear actin is causally linked to the high-metastatic ability of HCC cells by modulating chromatin accessibility and coordinating the expression of genes associated with extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis and cell migration. Mechanistically, TFAM deficiency blocked the TCA cycle and increased the intracellular malonyl-CoA levels. Malonylation of mDia2, which drives actin assembly, promotes its nuclear translocation. Importantly, inhibition of malonyl-CoA production or nuclear actin polymerization significantly impeded the spread of HCC cells in mice. Moreover, TFAM was significantly downregulated in metastatic HCC tissues and was associated with overall survival and time to tumor recurrence of HCC patients. Taken together, our study connects mitochondria to the metastasis of human cancer via uncovered mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde signaling, indicating that TFAM may serve as an effective target to block HCC metastasis."

            "Earlier studies linked sorafenib effectiveness to induction of ferroptosis. Herein we demonstrate sorafenib and mTKIs downregulate DDX5 in vitro and in vivo. To understand the effect of DDX5 downregulation, we compared TCGA-derived HCCs expressing low vs. high DDX5 focusing on ferroptosis-related genes. Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key ferroptosis regulator, was significantly overexpressed in DDX5LOW HCCs. Importantly, DDX5-knockdown (DDX5KD) HCC cell lines lacked lipid peroxidation by GPX4 inhibition, indicating DDX5 downregulation suppresses ferroptosis. RNAseq analyses comparing wild type vs. DDX5KD cells in the presence or absence of sorafenib, identified a unique set of genes repressed by DDX5 and upregulated by sorafenib. This set significantly overlaps genes from Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways, including NF-\u03baB inducing Kinase required for non-canonical NF-\u03baB activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of these pathways in combination with sorafenib reduced DDX5KD cell viability. Mechanistically, sorafenib-mediated NF-\u03baB activation induced NRF2 transcription, while DDX5KD extended NRF2 half/life by stabilizing p62/SQSTM1, leading to enhanced expression of GPX4 and ferroptosis escape. Conclusion: Sorafenib/mTKI-mediated DDX5 downregulation results in adaptive mTKI resistance by enhancing NRF2 expression, leading to ferroptosis escape. We propose inhibition of the pathways leading to NRF2 expression will enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of sorafenib/mTKIs."

            "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Hepatoblastoma (HB) are two liver cancers characterized by high gene deregulation, chromosomal rearrangements and typical mutations in genes related to the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin (Wnt) pathway. LHX2, a transcriptional factor member of the LIM homeobox gene family, has important functions in embryogenesis, liver development but also tumorigenesis. LHX2 is an oncogene in may solid tumors and leukemia but its role in liver cancer is unknown. To address this question we analyzed the expression of LHX2 in HCC and HB using various transcriptomic datasets and found a strong connection between LHX2 down-regulation and Wnt activation in these two liver cancers. In HB LHX2 downregulation correlated with multiple poor outcome parameters including higher patient age, intermediate- and high-risk tumors and patients\u2019 survival. A forced expression of LHX2 reduced the proliferation, the migration and the survival of hepatoma cells in vitro through the inactivation of MAPK/ERK and Wnt signalings. In vivo, LHX2 impeded the development of tumors in the chick embryo and repressed the Wnt pathway in Xenopus embryo. RNA-sequencing data and bioinformatic analyses confirmed the deregulation of many biological functions and molecular processes associated with cell migration, cell survival and liver carcinogenesis in LHX2-expressing hepatoma cells. At a mechanistic level, LHX2 induced the disassembling of beta-catenin and T-cell factor 4 and the expression of multiple inhibitors of Wnt (e.g. TLE/Groucho) and MAPK/ERK (e.g. DUSPs) pathways. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the tumor suppressive function of LHX2 in adult and pediatric liver cancers."

            "The tumor microenvironment is distinctive in primary and secondary liver cancer. B cells represent an important component of immune infiltrates. Here, we demonstrated that B cells are an important regulator in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) microenvironments. B cells displayed distinct developmental trajectories in HCC and CRLM. Single-cell analysis revealed that IgG+ plasma cells preferentially accumulated in HCC while IgA+ plasma cells were preferentially enriched in CRLM. Mechanistically, IgG+ plasma cells in HCC were recruited by tumor-associated macrophages via the CXCR3-CXCL10 axis, whereas IgA+ plasma cells in CRLM were recruited by metastatic tumor cells via CCR10-CCL28 signaling. Functionally, IgG+ plasma cells preferentially promoted pro-tumorigenic macrophages formation in HCC, and IgA+ plasma cells preferentially induced granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells activation in CRLM. Clinically, increased infiltration of IgG+ plasma cells and macrophages in HCC was correlated to worse survival, while increased intratumoral IgA+ plasma cells and neutrophils in CRLM indicated poor prognosis. Taken together, this study demonstrated plasma and myeloid cell-mediated immunosuppression in HCC and CRLM, suggesting that selectively modulating primary or secondary tumor-related immunosuppressive regulatory networks might reprogram the microenvironment and provide an immunotherapeutic strategy for treating liver cancer."

Using this unique model system, we delineated the functional consequences of chr8p loss and its impact on metastatic behavior and patient survival. We found that metastasis associated genes on chr8p act in concert to induce an aggressive and invasive phenotype characteristic for chr8p deleted tumors. The conjunction of engineered  chromosome-scale CNAs and genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 viability screenings served as a powerful tool for the discovery of novel synthetic lethal targets and vulnerabilities accompanying patient-specific copy number changes. Using this target identification strategy, we showed that chr8p deletion sensitizes tumor cells to targeting of the reactive oxygen sanitizing enzyme Nudix hydrolase 17 (NUDT17)."

            "Liver cancer claims over 800,000 human deaths each year. Liver cancer is notoriously refractory to conventional therapeutics. Further insight into the etiology carries promise for innovative diagnostics and therapeutics. Tumor progression is governed by interplay between tumor promoting genes and suppressor genes. BRD4, an acetyl-lysine binding protein, plays a critical role in development and human diseases. In many cancer types, BRD4 is overexpressed and promotes activation of a pro-tumor gene network. But the underlying mechanism for BRD4 overexpression remains elusive. As BRD4 has risen as a promising therapeutic target, to understand the mechanism regulating BRD4 protein level will shed insight into BRD4-targeting therapeutics. In this study, we find BRD4 protein level in liver cancer is significantly regulated by P53, the most frequently dysregulated tumor suppressor. We identify a strong negative correlation between protein levels of P53 and BRD4 in liver cancer. We then show P53 promotes BRD4 protein degradation. Mechanistically, P53 represses the transcription of USP1, a deubiquitinase, through P21-RB. We show USP1 is a deubiquitinase of BRD4, which increases its stability. We show the pro-tumor role of USP1 is partially mediated by BRD4 and the USP1-BRD4 axis upholds expression of a group of cancer-related genes. In summary, we identify a functional P53-P21-RB-USP1-BRD4 axis in liver cancer."

However, the heterogeneity of molecular markers of LCSCs has hindered the development of effective methods to isolate them. This study introduced a pioneering approach to isolate and culture LCSCs from primary tumor tissues, leveraging mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) as a feeder cell to provide the niche in conjunction with using defined medium, which stands in stark contrast to traditional techniques, and promised to revolutionize our understanding of LCSCs. Total seventeen cell strains were directly isolated from 24 patients\u2019 tissues without sorting, seven of which could be maintained long-term culture as colony growth on MEFs, which is unique characteristics of stem cells. Cloned cells formed a round packed morphology on MEFs and could be cryopreserved and re-cultured. Even 10 of cloned cells could form xenografts of human liver cancers in immunodeficient mice, indicating high tumorigenicity. Thus, cloned cells could be designated as liver cancer stem cells. Our further investigation found that reported putative liver cancer stem cell markers were all expressed in cloned cells, and stemness of cancer stem cells could well maintained under our developed culture conditions when compared to those under traditional suspension conditions. Furthermore, our findings revealed a distinct molecular landscape within hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), pinpointing a C2 subtype with profound implications for personalized medicine and the development of targeted therapies. By illuminating the unique responses of this subtype to chemotherapeutic agents, our research not only advances the frontiers of liver cancer biology but also charts a course for more effective, patient-specific treatment strategies."

            "The rising incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a global problem. Several approved treatments, including immune therapy and multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are used for treatment, although the results are not optimum. There is an unmet need to develop highly effective chemotherapies for HCC. Targeting multiple pathways to attack cancer cells is beneficial. Cabozantinib is an orally available bioactive multikinase inhibitor and has a modest effect on HCC treatment. Silmitasertib is an orally bioavailable, potent CK2 inhibitor with a direct role in DNA damage repair and is in clinical trial for other cancers. In this study, we planned to repurpose these existing drugs on HCC treatment.  We observed stronger antiproliferative effect of these two combined drugs on HCC cells generated from different etiologies as compared to the single treatment. Global RNA-seq analyses revealed a decrease in the expression of G2/M cell cycle transition genes in HCC cells following combination treatment, suggesting G2 phase cell arrest. We observed G2/M cell cycle phase arrest in HCC cells upon combination treatment compared to the single-treated or vehicle-treated control cells. The downregulation of CCNA2 and CDC25C following combination therapy further supported the observation. Subsequent analyses demonstrated that combination treatment inhibited 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) phosphorylation, and increased Bim expression. Apoptosis of HCC cells were accompanied by increased poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and caspase-9 activation. Next, we observed that a combination therapy significantly delayed the progression of HCC xenograft growth as compared to vehicle control. Together, our results suggested combining cabozantinib and silmitasertib would be a promising treatment option for HCC."

Although targeted therapeutic drugs have achieved certain clinical efficacy, only sorafenib and lenvatinib are currently marketed as first-line targeted drugs to treat patients with advanced liver cancer. Therefore, developing more drugs are urgently needed. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent programmed cell death (PCD) distinct from known PCDs including apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. Targeting ferroptosis is recognized as a promising potential therapeutic modality for liver cancer. Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is an important ferroptosis inducer and targeting ATF3 offers a potential means to cancer therapy. In the present study, we reported for the first time a sophoridine derivative 6j with promising anti-liver cancer effects in vitro and in vivo. Compound 6j could induce liver cancer cells ferroptosis by promoting the accumulation of intracellular Fe2+, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and MDA. Inhibition of ferroptosis by ferrostatin-1 alleviated 6j induced accumulation of Fe2+, ROS, and MDA and restored cell viability. Further study revealed that compound 6j upregulated the expression of ATF3 via ER stress and knockdown of ATF3 by RNA interference attenuated 6j induced ferroptosis and cell proliferation inhibition. This study would provide new insights for the design of ferroptosis inducers and the development of anti-liver cancer drugs."

Single-cell analysis revealed that IgG+ plasma cells preferentially accumulated in HCC while IgA+ plasma cells were preferentially enriched in CRLM. Mechanistically, IgG+ plasma cells in HCC were recruited by tumor-associated macrophages via the CXCR3-CXCL10 axis, whereas IgA+ plasma cells in CRLM were recruited by metastatic tumor cells via CCR10-CCL28 signaling.

Taken together, this study demonstrated plasma and myeloid cell-mediated immunosuppression in HCC and CRLM, suggesting that selectively modulating primary or secondary tumor-related immunosuppressive regulatory networks might reprogram the microenvironment and provide an immunotherapeutic strategy for treating liver cancer."

            "Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer.  However, mechanisms underlying metabolic reprogramming and how altered metabolism in turn enhances tumorigenicity are poorly understood.  Here, we report that arginine levels are elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) despite reduced expression of arginine synthesis genes, in murine and patient tumors.  Tumor cells accumulate high levels of arginine due to increased uptake and reduced arginine-to-polyamine conversion.  Importantly, the high levels of arginine promote tumor formation via further metabolic reprogramming, including changes in glucose, amino acid, nucleotide, and fatty acid metabolism.  Mechanistically, arginine binds RNA-binding motif protein 39 (RBM39) to control expression of metabolic genes.  RBM39-mediated upregulation of asparagine synthesis leads to enhanced arginine uptake, creating a positive feedback loop to sustain high arginine levels and oncogenic metabolism.  Thus, arginine is a second messenger-like molecule that reprograms metabolism to promote tumor growth."

            "The mechanisms underlying cancer metastasis remain poorly understood. Here, we report that TFAM deficiency rapidly and stably induced spontaneous lung metastasis in mice with liver cancer. Interestingly, unexpected polymerization of nuclear actin was observed in TFAM-knockdown HCC cells when cytoskeleton was examined. Polymerization of nuclear actin is causally linked to the high-metastatic ability of HCC cells by modulating chromatin accessibility and coordinating the expression of genes associated with extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis and cell migration. Mechanistically, TFAM deficiency blocked the TCA cycle and increased the intracellular malonyl-CoA levels. Malonylation of mDia2, which drives actin assembly, promotes its nuclear translocation. Importantly, inhibition of malonyl-CoA production or nuclear actin polymerization significantly impeded the spread of HCC cells in mice. Moreover, TFAM was significantly downregulated in metastatic HCC tissues and was associated with overall survival and time to tumor recurrence of HCC patients. Taken together, our study connects mitochondria to the metastasis of human cancer via uncovered mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde signaling, indicating that TFAM may serve as an effective target to block HCC metastasis."

We identified an immunomodulatory fibroblast population, FAP+CCL19+CCL21+ CAFs, that expressed signatures of fibroblastic reticular cells and was associated with favorable prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These CAFs exhibited the potential to recruit NK cells and regulate tumor-associated macrophages, and appeared to be regulated by CXCL12+ endothelial cells in tumors through specific ligand-receptor interaction. Further, we uncovered clonal HBV integration events enriched in tumor cells, and trajectory analysis on tumor cells with clonal HBV integration events revealed that hepatoblast-like cells differentiated into a terminal state with high expression of an immune-resistance program. The intercellular crosstalks between CAFs and cancer cells, macrophages, and NK cells, combined with HBV-based lineage tracing, provide a better understanding for functional roles of CAFs in the HCC microenvironment, and the relationship between HBV integration and liver malignancies."

            "The rising incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a global problem. Several approved treatments, including immune therapy and multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are used for treatment, although the results are not optimum. There is an unmet need to develop highly effective chemotherapies for HCC. Targeting multiple pathways to attack cancer cells is beneficial. Cabozantinib is an orally available bioactive multikinase inhibitor and has a modest effect on HCC treatment. Silmitasertib is an orally bioavailable, potent CK2 inhibitor with a direct role in DNA damage repair and is in clinical trial for other cancers. In this study, we planned to repurpose these existing drugs on HCC treatment.  We observed stronger antiproliferative effect of these two combined drugs on HCC cells generated from different etiologies as compared to the single treatment. Global RNA-seq analyses revealed a decrease in the expression of G2/M cell cycle transition genes in HCC cells following combination treatment, suggesting G2 phase cell arrest. We observed G2/M cell cycle phase arrest in HCC cells upon combination treatment compared to the single-treated or vehicle-treated control cells. The downregulation of CCNA2 and CDC25C following combination therapy further supported the observation. Subsequent analyses demonstrated that combination treatment inhibited 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) phosphorylation, and increased Bim expression. Apoptosis of HCC cells were accompanied by increased poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and caspase-9 activation. Next, we observed that a combination therapy significantly delayed the progression of HCC xenograft growth as compared to vehicle control. Together, our results suggested combining cabozantinib and silmitasertib would be a promising treatment option for HCC."

            "Liver cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies with an annual death of over 830,000 cases. Although targeted therapeutic drugs have achieved certain clinical efficacy, only sorafenib and lenvatinib are currently marketed as first-line targeted drugs to treat patients with advanced liver cancer. Therefore, developing more drugs are urgently needed. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent programmed cell death (PCD) distinct from known PCDs including apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. Targeting ferroptosis is recognized as a promising potential therapeutic modality for liver cancer. Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is an important ferroptosis inducer and targeting ATF3 offers a potential means to cancer therapy. In the present study, we reported for the first time a sophoridine derivative 6j with promising anti-liver cancer effects in vitro and in vivo. Compound 6j could induce liver cancer cells ferroptosis by promoting the accumulation of intracellular Fe2+, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and MDA. Inhibition of ferroptosis by ferrostatin-1 alleviated 6j induced accumulation of Fe2+, ROS, and MDA and restored cell viability. Further study revealed that compound 6j upregulated the expression of ATF3 via ER stress and knockdown of ATF3 by RNA interference attenuated 6j induced ferroptosis and cell proliferation inhibition. This study would provide new insights for the design of ferroptosis inducers and the development of anti-liver cancer drugs."

We identified an immunomodulatory fibroblast population, FAP+CCL19+CCL21+ CAFs, that expressed signatures of fibroblastic reticular cells and was associated with favorable prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These CAFs exhibited the potential to recruit NK cells and regulate tumor-associated macrophages, and appeared to be regulated by CXCL12+ endothelial cells in tumors through specific ligand-receptor interaction. Further, we uncovered clonal HBV integration events enriched in tumor cells, and trajectory analysis on tumor cells with clonal HBV integration events revealed that hepatoblast-like cells differentiated into a terminal state with high expression of an immune-resistance program. The intercellular crosstalks between CAFs and cancer cells, macrophages, and NK cells, combined with HBV-based lineage tracing, provide a better understanding for functional roles of CAFs in the HCC microenvironment, and the relationship between HBV integration and liver malignancies."

AP-1 is a dimeric basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor complex with JUN and FOS proteins being the most abundant members of this family. Unlike FOS, JUN can also form homodimers, but in the cell, JUN presumably preferentially forms heterodimers with members of the FOS family, which act as potent transcriptional activators. Previous studies identified substantial co-occupancy of YAP/TAZ and AP-1 at genomic sites, and they demonstrated that JUN/FOS heterodimers cooperate with the YAP/TAZ and TEAD transcription factors to drive YAP/TAZ target gene expression.

            "Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a liver cancer of adolescents and young adults defined by fusion of the DNAJB1 heat shock protein and protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunit (DNAJB1-PRKACA). The resulting chimeric protein has increased kinase activity and is essential for FLC xenograft growth. However, the critical oncogenic pathways controlled by DNAJB1-PRKACA have not been defined. Here, we explored this question by studying patient-derived FLC models and engineered systems and analyzing patient samples. We show that the core function of DNAJB1-PRKACA is the direct phosphorylation and inactivation of the Salt-inducible kinases. This leads to deregulation of the CRTC2 co-activator and p300 acetyltransferase, resulting in transcriptional reprogramming and global increases in histone acetylation necessary for malignant growth. Our studies establish a central oncogenic mechanism of DNAJB1-PRKACA and suggest opportunities for therapeutic targeting of CRTC2/p300 in FLC. Notably, these findings link this signature fusion oncoprotein of a rare cancer type to more common cancer gene alterations involving the STK11 tumor suppressor and GNAS oncogene, which also function via SIK suppression."

            "Fatty liver is a condition of excessive triglyceride accumulation in hepatocytes. Additionally, hepatocytes showed a high degree of fat droplet accumulation during excessive alcohol consumption and metabolic syndrome. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in fat droplet formation remain unknown. This study used an in vitro fatty liver formation model of the human liver cancer cell line HepG2 to comprehensively search for fat droplet formation-related genes whose expression changes during fat droplet formation. Microarray analysis with extracted total RNA determined the genes that are involved in fat droplet formation and confirmed their expression by real-time polymerase chain reaction after culturing HepG2 cells in a culture medium containing 0, 50, 200, and 500 \u03bcM of oleic acid for 24 h. The results revealed 142 genes demonstrating increased expressions by >2.0 fold with oleic acid treatment and 426 genes demonstrating decreased expressions. Perilipin 2 (PLIN2) was estimated as the gene most closely associated with fatty liver. Lipid droplet formation in HepG2 upregulated PLIN2 in an oleic acid-treated concentration-dependent manner. These results indicate the involvement of genes in oleate treatment-induced lipid droplet formation in HepG2, particularly PLIN2 may play an important role."

Senescence induction may represent a strategy for cancer treatment, especially as a combination therapy. The posttranslational modification (PTM) of proteins critically influences many biological processes, including gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, tumor progression, and drug resistance. Herein, we newly discovered that the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Human antigen R (HuR), a hub in liver cancer, is SUMOylated in the tumor sections of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in contrast to the surrounding tissue, as well as in human cell line and mouse models of the disease. SUMOylation of HuR promotes major cancer hallmarks, namely proliferation and invasion, whereas the absence of HuR SUMOylation results in a senescent phenotype with dysfunctional mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mechanistically, SUMOylation induces a structural rearrangement of the RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that modulates HuR binding affinity to its target mRNAs further modifying the transcriptomic profile towards hepatic tumor progression."

Single-cell analysis revealed that IgG+ plasma cells preferentially accumulated in HCC while IgA+ plasma cells were preferentially enriched in CRLM. Mechanistically, IgG+ plasma cells in HCC were recruited by tumor-associated macrophages via the CXCR3-CXCL10 axis, whereas IgA+ plasma cells in CRLM were recruited by metastatic tumor cells via CCR10-CCL28 signaling. Functionally, IgG+ plasma cells preferentially promoted pro-tumorigenic macrophages formation in HCC, and IgA+ plasma cells preferentially induced granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells activation in CRLM. Clinically, increased infiltration of IgG+ plasma cells and macrophages in HCC was correlated to worse survival, while increased intratumoral IgA+ plasma cells and neutrophils in CRLM indicated poor prognosis. Taken together, this study demonstrated plasma and myeloid cell-mediated immunosuppression in HCC and CRLM, suggesting that selectively modulating primary or secondary tumor-related immunosuppressive regulatory networks might reprogram the microenvironment and provide an immunotherapeutic strategy for treating liver cancer."

Notwithstanding the unique pathological feature of i-CHC, its molecular characteristics is not fully elucidated yet.",
            "Methods: To obtain molecular insights on the i-CHC, RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) profiling were performed on the tissues of i-CHC, HCC, and iCCA, respectively.",
            "Results: i-CHC showed unique transcriptomic features differing from HCC and iCCA, showing higher expression of Notch signaling and frequent splicing events of intron-retention (IR). Noticeably, we found that i-CHC had DNA-copy number loss and concomitant transcriptional suppression of METTL16, which may contribute to the aggressive progression of i-CHC via Notch activation.",

            "Recent studies have indicated a multi-directional seeding of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Apart from seeding to distant tissues (cancer metastases), CTCs can also reinfiltrate and colonize already established tumors. This process of \u201ctumor self-seeding\u201d provides new insights into the dynamics of tumor progression, and has been indicated to promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, and invasion. Thus, therapeutic targeting of tumor self-seeded cells (TSCs) may provide effective strategies for preventing tumor progression. However, TSCs have not been well identified and characterized due to unsuitable animal models. Therefore, this study aims to develop a novel animal model to recapitulate the process of tumor self-seeding and characterize the transcriptional and functional profiles of TSCs in liver cancer. Using our tumor self-seeding model, TSCs, primary tumor cells (PCs), and CTCs were identified and isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). RNA sequencing of the purified cells identified TSCs as a subpopulation of PCs. Further analyses showed that TSCs were enriched with gene sets of cancer metastasis and invasiveness, suggesting TSCs may provide novel cell targets with diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic potential."

            "The mechanisms underlying cancer metastasis remain poorly understood. Here, we report that TFAM deficiency rapidly and stably induced spontaneous lung metastasis in mice with liver cancer. Interestingly, unexpected polymerization of nuclear actin was observed in TFAM-knockdown HCC cells when cytoskeleton was examined. Polymerization of nuclear actin is causally linked to the high-metastatic ability of HCC cells by modulating chromatin accessibility and coordinating the expression of genes associated with extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis and cell migration. Mechanistically, TFAM deficiency blocked the TCA cycle and increased the intracellular malonyl-CoA levels. Malonylation of mDia2, which drives actin assembly, promotes its nuclear translocation. Importantly, inhibition of malonyl-CoA production or nuclear actin polymerization significantly impeded the spread of HCC cells in mice. Moreover, TFAM was significantly downregulated in metastatic HCC tissues and was associated with overall survival and time to tumor recurrence of HCC patients. Taken together, our study connects mitochondria to the metastasis of human cancer via uncovered mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde signaling, indicating that TFAM may serve as an effective target to block HCC metastasis."

We identified an immunomodulatory fibroblast population, FAP+CCL19+CCL21+ CAFs, that expressed signatures of fibroblastic reticular cells and was associated with favorable prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These CAFs exhibited the potential to recruit NK cells and regulate tumor-associated macrophages, and appeared to be regulated by CXCL12+ endothelial cells in tumors through specific ligand-receptor interaction. Further, we uncovered clonal HBV integration events enriched in tumor cells, and trajectory analysis on tumor cells with clonal HBV integration events revealed that hepatoblast-like cells differentiated into a terminal state with high expression of an immune-resistance program. The intercellular crosstalks between CAFs and cancer cells, macrophages, and NK cells, combined with HBV-based lineage tracing, provide a better understanding for functional roles of CAFs in the HCC microenvironment, and the relationship between HBV integration and liver malignancies."

            "Recent studies have indicated a multi-directional seeding of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Apart from seeding to distant tissues (cancer metastases), CTCs can also reinfiltrate and colonize already established tumors. This process of \u201ctumor self-seeding\u201d provides new insights into the dynamics of tumor progression, and has been indicated to promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, and invasion. Thus, therapeutic targeting of tumor self-seeded cells (TSCs) may provide effective strategies for preventing tumor progression. However, TSCs have not been well identified and characterized due to unsuitable animal models. Therefore, this study aims to develop a novel animal model to recapitulate the process of tumor self-seeding and characterize the transcriptional and functional profiles of TSCs in liver cancer. Using our tumor self-seeding model, TSCs, primary tumor cells (PCs), and CTCs were identified and isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). RNA sequencing of the purified cells identified TSCs as a subpopulation of PCs. Further analyses showed that TSCs were enriched with gene sets of cancer metastasis and invasiveness, suggesting TSCs may provide novel cell targets with diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic potential."

            "Here, we generated full-length single cell transcriptome data for ~9,000 cells from clinical samples of 11 liver cancer patients to delineate cellular relationships of diverse malignant, immune and stromal cells. We identified an immunomodulatory fibroblast population, FAP+CCL19+CCL21+ CAFs, that expressed signatures of fibroblastic reticular cells and was associated with favorable prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These CAFs exhibited the potential to recruit NK cells and regulate tumor-associated macrophages, and appeared to be regulated by CXCL12+ endothelial cells in tumors through specific ligand-receptor interaction. Further, we uncovered clonal HBV integration events enriched in tumor cells, and trajectory analysis on tumor cells with clonal HBV integration events revealed that hepatoblast-like cells differentiated into a terminal state with high expression of an immune-resistance program. The intercellular crosstalks between CAFs and cancer cells, macrophages, and NK cells, combined with HBV-based lineage tracing, provide a better understanding for functional roles of CAFs in the HCC microenvironment, and the relationship between HBV integration and liver malignancies."

Transcriptome sequencing and western blotting were respectively used to investigate transcription and expression changes in Hep3B cells treated with PMQ. Treatment with 30 and 100 \u03bcM PMQ more significantly inhibited cell growth and proliferation in Hep3B cells than in HepG2 and LO2 cells. PMQ induced Hep3B cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by significantly reducing CDK4, CDK6, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E1, Cyclin B1 and Bcl-2 expression and increasing Bax, CDK1 and cleaved PARP levels.

Senescence induction may represent a strategy for cancer treatment, especially as a combination therapy. The posttranslational modification (PTM) of proteins critically influences many biological processes, including gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, tumor progression, and drug resistance. Herein, we newly discovered that the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Human antigen R (HuR), a hub in liver cancer, is SUMOylated in the tumor sections of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in contrast to the surrounding tissue, as well as in human cell line and mouse models of the disease. SUMOylation of HuR promotes major cancer hallmarks, namely proliferation and invasion, whereas the absence of HuR SUMOylation results in a senescent phenotype with dysfunctional mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mechanistically, SUMOylation induces a structural rearrangement of the RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that modulates HuR binding affinity to its target mRNAs further modifying the transcriptomic profile towards hepatic tumor progression."

            "The clinical management of liver cancer is challenged by the reduced availability of drugs targeting key signaling pathways and their modest benefits to patients. Senescence induction may represent a strategy for cancer treatment, especially as a combination therapy. The posttranslational modification (PTM) of proteins critically influences many biological processes, including gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, tumor progression, and drug resistance. Herein, we newly discovered that the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Human antigen R (HuR), a hub in liver cancer, is SUMOylated in the tumor sections of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in contrast to the surrounding tissue, as well as in human cell line and mouse models of the disease. SUMOylation of HuR promotes major cancer hallmarks, namely proliferation and invasion, whereas the absence of HuR SUMOylation results in a senescent phenotype with dysfunctional mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mechanistically, SUMOylation induces a structural rearrangement of the RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that modulates HuR binding affinity to its target mRNAs further modifying the transcriptomic profile towards hepatic tumor progression."

            "Liver cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies with an annual death of over 830,000 cases. Although targeted therapeutic drugs have achieved certain clinical efficacy, only sorafenib and lenvatinib are currently marketed as first-line targeted drugs to treat patients with advanced liver cancer. Therefore, developing more drugs are urgently needed. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent programmed cell death (PCD) distinct from known PCDs including apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. Targeting ferroptosis is recognized as a promising potential therapeutic modality for liver cancer. Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is an important ferroptosis inducer and targeting ATF3 offers a potential means to cancer therapy. In the present study, we reported for the first time a sophoridine derivative 6j with promising anti-liver cancer effects in vitro and in vivo. Compound 6j could induce liver cancer cells ferroptosis by promoting the accumulation of intracellular Fe2+, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and MDA. Inhibition of ferroptosis by ferrostatin-1 alleviated 6j induced accumulation of Fe2+, ROS, and MDA and restored cell viability. Further study revealed that compound 6j upregulated the expression of ATF3 via ER stress and knockdown of ATF3 by RNA interference attenuated 6j induced ferroptosis and cell proliferation inhibition. This study would provide new insights for the design of ferroptosis inducers and the development of anti-liver cancer drugs."

        "summary": [
            "Earlier studies linked sorafenib effectiveness to induction of ferroptosis. Herein we demonstrate sorafenib and mTKIs downregulate DDX5 in vitro and in vivo. To understand the effect of DDX5 downregulation, we compared TCGA-derived HCCs expressing low vs. high DDX5 focusing on ferroptosis-related genes. Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key ferroptosis regulator, was significantly overexpressed in DDX5LOW HCCs. Importantly, DDX5-knockdown (DDX5KD) HCC cell lines lacked lipid peroxidation by GPX4 inhibition, indicating DDX5 downregulation suppresses ferroptosis. RNAseq analyses comparing wild type vs. DDX5KD cells in the presence or absence of sorafenib, identified a unique set of genes repressed by DDX5 and upregulated by sorafenib. This set significantly overlaps genes from Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways, including NF-\u03baB inducing Kinase required for non-canonical NF-\u03baB activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of these pathways in combination with sorafenib reduced DDX5KD cell viability. Mechanistically, sorafenib-mediated NF-\u03baB activation induced NRF2 transcription, while DDX5KD extended NRF2 half/life by stabilizing p62/SQSTM1, leading to enhanced expression of GPX4 and ferroptosis escape. Conclusion: Sorafenib/mTKI-mediated DDX5 downregulation results in adaptive mTKI resistance by enhancing NRF2 expression, leading to ferroptosis escape. We propose inhibition of the pathways leading to NRF2 expression will enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of sorafenib/mTKIs."

Here, we demonstrated that B cells are an important regulator in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) microenvironments. B cells displayed distinct developmental trajectories in HCC and CRLM. Single-cell analysis revealed that IgG+ plasma cells preferentially accumulated in HCC while IgA+ plasma cells were preferentially enriched in CRLM. Mechanistically, IgG+ plasma cells in HCC were recruited by tumor-associated macrophages via the CXCR3-CXCL10 axis, whereas IgA+ plasma cells in CRLM were recruited by metastatic tumor cells via CCR10-CCL28 signaling. Functionally, IgG+ plasma cells preferentially promoted pro-tumorigenic macrophages formation in HCC, and IgA+ plasma cells preferentially induced granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells activation in CRLM. Clinically, increased infiltration of IgG+ plasma cells and macrophages in HCC was correlated to worse survival, while increased intratumoral IgA+ plasma cells and neutrophils in CRLM indicated poor prognosis. Taken together, this study demonstrated plasma and myeloid cell-mediated immunosuppression in HCC and CRLM, suggesting that selectively modulating primary or secondary tumor-related immunosuppressive regulatory networks might reprogram the microenvironment and provide an immunotherapeutic strategy for treating liver cancer."

Accurate Long-read transcriptome sequencing at single-cell level is required to decipher the spectrum of protein expressions in mammalian organisms. In this report, we developed a synthetic long-read single-cell sequencing technology based on LOOPseq technique. We applied this technology to analyze 447 transcriptomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and benign liver from an individual. Through Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) analysis, we identified a panel of mutation mRNA isoforms highly specific to HCC cells. The evolution pathways that led to the hyper-mutation clusters in single human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules were identified. Novel fusion transcripts were detected. The combination of gene expressions, fusion gene transcripts, and mutation gene expressions significantly improved the classification of liver cancer cells versus benign hepatocytes. In conclusion, LOOPseq single-cell technology may hold promise to provide a new level of precision analysis on the mammalian transcriptome."

Notwithstanding the unique pathological feature of i-CHC, its molecular characteristics is not fully elucidated yet.",
            "Methods: To obtain molecular insights on the i-CHC, RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) profiling were performed on the tissues of i-CHC, HCC, and iCCA, respectively.",
            "Results: i-CHC showed unique transcriptomic features differing from HCC and iCCA, showing higher expression of Notch signaling and frequent splicing events of intron-retention (IR). Noticeably, we found that i-CHC had DNA-copy number loss and concomitant transcriptional suppression of METTL16, which may contribute to the aggressive progression of i-CHC via Notch activation.",

            "Recent studies have indicated a multi-directional seeding of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Apart from seeding to distant tissues (cancer metastases), CTCs can also reinfiltrate and colonize already established tumors. This process of \u201ctumor self-seeding\u201d provides new insights into the dynamics of tumor progression, and has been indicated to promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, and invasion. Thus, therapeutic targeting of tumor self-seeded cells (TSCs) may provide effective strategies for preventing tumor progression. However, TSCs have not been well identified and characterized due to unsuitable animal models. Therefore, this study aims to develop a novel animal model to recapitulate the process of tumor self-seeding and characterize the transcriptional and functional profiles of TSCs in liver cancer. Using our tumor self-seeding model, TSCs, primary tumor cells (PCs), and CTCs were identified and isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). RNA sequencing of the purified cells identified TSCs as a subpopulation of PCs. Further analyses showed that TSCs were enriched with gene sets of cancer metastasis and invasiveness, suggesting TSCs may provide novel cell targets with diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic potential."

        "summary": [
            "Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a liver cancer of adolescents and young adults defined by fusion of the DNAJB1 heat shock protein and protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunit (DNAJB1-PRKACA). The resulting chimeric protein has increased kinase activity and is essential for FLC xenograft growth. However, the critical oncogenic pathways controlled by DNAJB1-PRKACA have not been defined. Here, we explored this question by studying patient-derived FLC models and engineered systems and analyzing patient samples. We show that the core function of DNAJB1-PRKACA is the direct phosphorylation and inactivation of the Salt-inducible kinases. This leads to deregulation of the CRTC2 co-activator and p300 acetyltransferase, resulting in transcriptional reprogramming and global increases in histone acetylation necessary for malignant growth. Our studies establish a central oncogenic mechanism of DNAJB1-PRKACA and suggest opportunities for therapeutic targeting of CRTC2/p300 in FLC. Notably, these findings link this signature fusion oncoprotein of a rare cancer type to more common cancer gene alterations involving the STK11 tumor suppressor and GNAS oncogene, which also function via SIK suppression."

            "The tumor microenvironment is distinctive in primary and secondary liver cancer. B cells represent an important component of immune infiltrates. Here, we demonstrated that B cells are an important regulator in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) microenvironments. B cells displayed distinct developmental trajectories in HCC and CRLM. Single-cell analysis revealed that IgG+ plasma cells preferentially accumulated in HCC while IgA+ plasma cells were preferentially enriched in CRLM. Mechanistically, IgG+ plasma cells in HCC were recruited by tumor-associated macrophages via the CXCR3-CXCL10 axis, whereas IgA+ plasma cells in CRLM were recruited by metastatic tumor cells via CCR10-CCL28 signaling. Functionally, IgG+ plasma cells preferentially promoted pro-tumorigenic macrophages formation in HCC, and IgA+ plasma cells preferentially induced granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells activation in CRLM. Clinically, increased infiltration of IgG+ plasma cells and macrophages in HCC was correlated to worse survival, while increased intratumoral IgA+ plasma cells and neutrophils in CRLM indicated poor prognosis. Taken together, this study demonstrated plasma and myeloid cell-mediated immunosuppression in HCC and CRLM, suggesting that selectively modulating primary or secondary tumor-related immunosuppressive regulatory networks might reprogram the microenvironment and provide an immunotherapeutic strategy for treating liver cancer."

            "Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer.  However, mechanisms underlying metabolic reprogramming and how altered metabolism in turn enhances tumorigenicity are poorly understood.  Here, we report that arginine levels are elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) despite reduced expression of arginine synthesis genes, in murine and patient tumors.  Tumor cells accumulate high levels of arginine due to increased uptake and reduced arginine-to-polyamine conversion.  Importantly, the high levels of arginine promote tumor formation via further metabolic reprogramming, including changes in glucose, amino acid, nucleotide, and fatty acid metabolism.  Mechanistically, arginine binds RNA-binding motif protein 39 (RBM39) to control expression of metabolic genes.  RBM39-mediated upregulation of asparagine synthesis leads to enhanced arginine uptake, creating a positive feedback loop to sustain high arginine levels and oncogenic metabolism.  Thus, arginine is a second messenger-like molecule that reprograms metabolism to promote tumor growth."

            "The transcriptional coactivators YAP/TAZ are the critical downstream regulators of the Hippo pathway that regulate gene expression in response to changes in pathway activity, mainly by binding to TEAD transcription factors. Uncontrolled transcriptional output of YAP/TAZ can lead to rapid induction of aggressive tumor growth. AP-1 is a dimeric basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor complex with JUN and FOS proteins being the most abundant members of this family. Unlike FOS, JUN can also form homodimers, but in the cell, JUN presumably preferentially forms heterodimers with members of the FOS family, which act as potent transcriptional activators. Previous studies identified substantial co-occupancy of YAP/TAZ and AP-1 at genomic sites, and they demonstrated that JUN/FOS heterodimers cooperate with the YAP/TAZ and TEAD transcription factors to drive YAP/TAZ target gene expression. Here, we now elucidate a negative feedback mechanism in which high YAP activity is restrained by the recruitment of homodimeric JUN::JUN/NCOR1 repressor complexes and show that this noncanonical JUN function is part of a tumor suppressor mechanism in the liver."

            "Hexokinases (HKs), a group of enzymes catalyzing the first step of glycolysis, have been shown to play important roles in liver metabolism and tumorigenesis. Our recent studies identified HKDC1 as a top candidate associated with liver cancer metastasis. We aimed to compare its cell type specificity with other HKs upregulated in liver cancer and investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying its involvement in liver cancer metastasis. We found that, compared to HK1 and HK2, the other two commonly upregulated HKs in liver cancer, HKDC1 was most strongly associated with the metastasis potential of tumors and organoids derived from two liver cancer mouse models we previously established. RNA in situ hybridization and single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed that HKDC1 was specifically upregulated in malignant cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patient tumors, whereas HK1 and HK2 were widespread across various tumor microenvironment lineages. An unbiased metabolomic profiling demonstrated that HKDC1 overexpression in HCC cells led to metabolic alterations distinct from those from HK1 and HK2 overexpression, with HKDC1 particularly impacting the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. HKDC1 was prometastatic in HCC orthotopic and tail vein injection mouse models. Molecularly, HKDC1 was induced by hypoxia and bound to glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 to stabilize \u03b2-catenin, leading to enhanced stemness of HCC cells. Overall, our findings underscore HKDC1 as a prometastatic HK specifically expressed in the malignant compartment of primary liver tumors, thereby providing a mechanistic basis for targeting this enzyme in advanced liver cancer."

Here, we report that TFAM deficiency rapidly and stably induced spontaneous lung metastasis in mice with liver cancer.

Polymerization of nuclear actin is causally linked to the high-metastatic ability of HCC cells by modulating chromatin accessibility and coordinating the expression of genes associated with extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis and cell migration. Mechanistically, TFAM deficiency blocked the TCA cycle and increased the intracellular malonyl-CoA levels. Malonylation of mDia2, which drives actin assembly, promotes its nuclear translocation. Importantly, inhibition of malonyl-CoA production or nuclear actin polymerization significantly impeded the spread of HCC cells in mice. Moreover, TFAM was significantly downregulated in metastatic HCC tissues and was associated with overall survival and time to tumor recurrence of HCC patients.

Clinically, increased infiltration of IgG+ plasma cells and macrophages in HCC was correlated to worse survival, while increased intratumoral IgA+ plasma cells and neutrophils in CRLM indicated poor prognosis. Taken together, this study demonstrated plasma and myeloid cell-mediated immunosuppression in HCC and CRLM, suggesting that selectively modulating primary or secondary tumor-related immunosuppressive regulatory networks might reprogram the microenvironment and provide an immunotherapeutic strategy for treating liver cancer."

            "Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer.  However, mechanisms underlying metabolic reprogramming and how altered metabolism in turn enhances tumorigenicity are poorly understood.  Here, we report that arginine levels are elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) despite reduced expression of arginine synthesis genes, in murine and patient tumors.  Tumor cells accumulate high levels of arginine due to increased uptake and reduced arginine-to-polyamine conversion.  Importantly, the high levels of arginine promote tumor formation via further metabolic reprogramming, including changes in glucose, amino acid, nucleotide, and fatty acid metabolism.  Mechanistically, arginine binds RNA-binding motif protein 39 (RBM39) to control expression of metabolic genes.  RBM39-mediated upregulation of asparagine synthesis leads to enhanced arginine uptake, creating a positive feedback loop to sustain high arginine levels and oncogenic metabolism.  Thus, arginine is a second messenger-like molecule that reprograms metabolism to promote tumor growth."

        "summary": [
            "Earlier studies linked sorafenib effectiveness to induction of ferroptosis. Herein we demonstrate sorafenib and mTKIs downregulate DDX5 in vitro and in vivo. To understand the effect of DDX5 downregulation, we compared TCGA-derived HCCs expressing low vs. high DDX5 focusing on ferroptosis-related genes. Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key ferroptosis regulator, was significantly overexpressed in DDX5LOW HCCs. Importantly, DDX5-knockdown (DDX5KD) HCC cell lines lacked lipid peroxidation by GPX4 inhibition, indicating DDX5 downregulation suppresses ferroptosis. RNAseq analyses comparing wild type vs. DDX5KD cells in the presence or absence of sorafenib, identified a unique set of genes repressed by DDX5 and upregulated by sorafenib. This set significantly overlaps genes from Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways, including NF-\u03baB inducing Kinase required for non-canonical NF-\u03baB activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of these pathways in combination with sorafenib reduced DDX5KD cell viability. Mechanistically, sorafenib-mediated NF-\u03baB activation induced NRF2 transcription, while DDX5KD extended NRF2 half/life by stabilizing p62/SQSTM1, leading to enhanced expression of GPX4 and ferroptosis escape. Conclusion: Sorafenib/mTKI-mediated DDX5 downregulation results in adaptive mTKI resistance by enhancing NRF2 expression, leading to ferroptosis escape. We propose inhibition of the pathways leading to NRF2 expression will enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of sorafenib/mTKIs."

The posttranslational modification (PTM) of proteins critically influences many biological processes, including gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, tumor progression, and drug resistance. Herein, we newly discovered that the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Human antigen R (HuR), a hub in liver cancer, is SUMOylated in the tumor sections of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in contrast to the surrounding tissue, as well as in human cell line and mouse models of the disease. SUMOylation of HuR promotes major cancer hallmarks, namely proliferation and invasion, whereas the absence of HuR SUMOylation results in a senescent phenotype with dysfunctional mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mechanistically, SUMOylation induces a structural rearrangement of the RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that modulates HuR binding affinity to its target mRNAs further modifying the transcriptomic profile towards hepatic tumor progression."

However, the heterogeneity of molecular markers of LCSCs has hindered the development of effective methods to isolate them. This study introduced a pioneering approach to isolate and culture LCSCs from primary tumor tissues, leveraging mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) as a feeder cell to provide the niche in conjunction with using defined medium, which stands in stark contrast to traditional techniques, and promised to revolutionize our understanding of LCSCs. Total seventeen cell strains were directly isolated from 24 patients\u2019 tissues without sorting, seven of which could be maintained long-term culture as colony growth on MEFs, which is unique characteristics of stem cells. Cloned cells formed a round packed morphology on MEFs and could be cryopreserved and re-cultured. Even 10 of cloned cells could form xenografts of human liver cancers in immunodeficient mice, indicating high tumorigenicity. Thus, cloned cells could be designated as liver cancer stem cells. Our further investigation found that reported putative liver cancer stem cell markers were all expressed in cloned cells, and stemness of cancer stem cells could well maintained under our developed culture conditions when compared to those under traditional suspension conditions. Furthermore, our findings revealed a distinct molecular landscape within hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), pinpointing a C2 subtype with profound implications for personalized medicine and the development of targeted therapies. By illuminating the unique responses of this subtype to chemotherapeutic agents, our research not only advances the frontiers of liver cancer biology but also charts a course for more effective, patient-specific treatment strategies."

We describe the establishment of chromosome-engineered hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines using a dual guided CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing strategy. A mega base-sized region on chromosome 8p (chr8p) was heterozygously deleted mimicking a frequently observed copy number alteration (CNA) of solid tumors. Using this unique model system, we delineated the functional consequences of chr8p loss and its impact on metastatic behavior and patient survival. We found that metastasis associated genes on chr8p act in concert to induce an aggressive and invasive phenotype characteristic for chr8p deleted tumors. The conjunction of engineered  chromosome-scale CNAs and genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 viability screenings served as a powerful tool for the discovery of novel synthetic lethal targets and vulnerabilities accompanying patient-specific copy number changes. Using this target identification strategy, we showed that chr8p deletion sensitizes tumor cells to targeting of the reactive oxygen sanitizing enzyme Nudix hydrolase 17 (NUDT17)."

            "Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer.  However, mechanisms underlying metabolic reprogramming and how altered metabolism in turn enhances tumorigenicity are poorly understood.  Here, we report that arginine levels are elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) despite reduced expression of arginine synthesis genes, in murine and patient tumors.  Tumor cells accumulate high levels of arginine due to increased uptake and reduced arginine-to-polyamine conversion.  Importantly, the high levels of arginine promote tumor formation via further metabolic reprogramming, including changes in glucose, amino acid, nucleotide, and fatty acid metabolism.  Mechanistically, arginine binds RNA-binding motif protein 39 (RBM39) to control expression of metabolic genes.  RBM39-mediated upregulation of asparagine synthesis leads to enhanced arginine uptake, creating a positive feedback loop to sustain high arginine levels and oncogenic metabolism.  Thus, arginine is a second messenger-like molecule that reprograms metabolism to promote tumor growth."

            "Recent studies have indicated a multi-directional seeding of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Apart from seeding to distant tissues (cancer metastases), CTCs can also reinfiltrate and colonize already established tumors. This process of \u201ctumor self-seeding\u201d provides new insights into the dynamics of tumor progression, and has been indicated to promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, and invasion. Thus, therapeutic targeting of tumor self-seeded cells (TSCs) may provide effective strategies for preventing tumor progression. However, TSCs have not been well identified and characterized due to unsuitable animal models. Therefore, this study aims to develop a novel animal model to recapitulate the process of tumor self-seeding and characterize the transcriptional and functional profiles of TSCs in liver cancer. Using our tumor self-seeding model, TSCs, primary tumor cells (PCs), and CTCs were identified and isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). RNA sequencing of the purified cells identified TSCs as a subpopulation of PCs. Further analyses showed that TSCs were enriched with gene sets of cancer metastasis and invasiveness, suggesting TSCs may provide novel cell targets with diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic potential."

AP-1 is a dimeric basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor complex with JUN and FOS proteins being the most abundant members of this family. Unlike FOS, JUN can also form homodimers, but in the cell, JUN presumably preferentially forms heterodimers with members of the FOS family, which act as potent transcriptional activators. Previous studies identified substantial co-occupancy of YAP/TAZ and AP-1 at genomic sites, and they demonstrated that JUN/FOS heterodimers cooperate with the YAP/TAZ and TEAD transcription factors to drive YAP/TAZ target gene expression.

We identified an immunomodulatory fibroblast population, FAP+CCL19+CCL21+ CAFs, that expressed signatures of fibroblastic reticular cells and was associated with favorable prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These CAFs exhibited the potential to recruit NK cells and regulate tumor-associated macrophages, and appeared to be regulated by CXCL12+ endothelial cells in tumors through specific ligand-receptor interaction. Further, we uncovered clonal HBV integration events enriched in tumor cells, and trajectory analysis on tumor cells with clonal HBV integration events revealed that hepatoblast-like cells differentiated into a terminal state with high expression of an immune-resistance program. The intercellular crosstalks between CAFs and cancer cells, macrophages, and NK cells, combined with HBV-based lineage tracing, provide a better understanding for functional roles of CAFs in the HCC microenvironment, and the relationship between HBV integration and liver malignancies."

Notwithstanding the unique pathological feature of i-CHC, its molecular characteristics is not fully elucidated yet.",

Noticeably, we found that i-CHC had DNA-copy number loss and concomitant transcriptional suppression of METTL16, which may contribute to the aggressive progression of i-CHC via Notch activation.",

            "Recent studies have shown that high cell cycle activity negatively correlates with antitumor immunity in certain cancer types. However, a similar correlation has not been proven in liver cancer.We downloaded transcriptomic profiles of TCGA-LIHC (the cancer genome atlas-liver hepatocellular carcinoma) and assessed the cell cycle distribution of samples using single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA), termed the cell cycle score (CCS). We obtained cell cycle-related differentially expressed prognostic genes and identified CENPA, CDC20 and CTSV using LASSO regression. We studied the effect of CTSV on clinical features and immune alterations in liver cancer based on TCGA-LIHC data. In vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to validate the role of CTSV in liver cancer using liver cancer cell lines and tissues.We found that the CCS closely correlated with the clinical features and prognosis of patients in TCGA-LIHC. Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), univariate Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression identified cathepsin V (CTSV) with prognostic significance in LIHC. Importantly, single-gene survival analysis of CTSV using microarray and sequencing data indicated that high levels of CTSV expression correlated with an unfavorable prognosis in various cancers. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that high CTSV expression closely correlated with decreased expression of metabolic genes and increased expression of cell cycle genes. Furthermore, difference and correlation analyses of the relationship between CTSV expression and immune infiltrates, determined using CIBERSORT and TIMER algorithms, revealed that CTSV expression correlated with macrophages and CD4+ T cells. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that knockdown of CTSV inhibited liver cancer cells proliferation. Immunohistochemical staining showed that high CTSV expression correlated with macrophage infiltration in liver cancer tissues, predicted a poor prognosis, and may serve as a biomarker for HCC therapy.In conclusion, CTSV is a novel cell cycle prognostic gene that can affect HCC cells proliferation, and a potential biomarker for HCC therapy."

        "summary": [
            "Liver cancer claims over 800,000 human deaths each year. Liver cancer is notoriously refractory to conventional therapeutics. Further insight into the etiology carries promise for innovative diagnostics and therapeutics. Tumor progression is governed by interplay between tumor promoting genes and suppressor genes. BRD4, an acetyl-lysine binding protein, plays a critical role in development and human diseases. In many cancer types, BRD4 is overexpressed and promotes activation of a pro-tumor gene network. But the underlying mechanism for BRD4 overexpression remains elusive. As BRD4 has risen as a promising therapeutic target, to understand the mechanism regulating BRD4 protein level will shed insight into BRD4-targeting therapeutics. In this study, we find BRD4 protein level in liver cancer is significantly regulated by P53, the most frequently dysregulated tumor suppressor. We identify a strong negative correlation between protein levels of P53 and BRD4 in liver cancer. We then show P53 promotes BRD4 protein degradation. Mechanistically, P53 represses the transcription of USP1, a deubiquitinase, through P21-RB. We show USP1 is a deubiquitinase of BRD4, which increases its stability. We show the pro-tumor role of USP1 is partially mediated by BRD4 and the USP1-BRD4 axis upholds expression of a group of cancer-related genes. In summary, we identify a functional P53-P21-RB-USP1-BRD4 axis in liver cancer."

Notwithstanding the unique pathological feature of i-CHC, its molecular characteristics is not fully elucidated yet.",

            "Results: i-CHC showed unique transcriptomic features differing from HCC and iCCA, showing higher expression of Notch signaling and frequent splicing events of intron-retention (IR). Noticeably, we found that i-CHC had DNA-copy number loss and concomitant transcriptional suppression of METTL16, which may contribute to the aggressive progression of i-CHC via Notch activation.",

            "Large-scale chromosomal aberrations are prevalent in human cancer but their functional effects remain poorly understood. We describe the establishment of chromosome-engineered hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines using a dual guided CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing strategy. A mega base-sized region on chromosome 8p (chr8p) was heterozygously deleted mimicking a frequently observed copy number alteration (CNA) of solid tumors. Using this unique model system, we delineated the functional consequences of chr8p loss and its impact on metastatic behavior and patient survival. We found that metastasis associated genes on chr8p act in concert to induce an aggressive and invasive phenotype characteristic for chr8p deleted tumors. The conjunction of engineered  chromosome-scale CNAs and genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 viability screenings served as a powerful tool for the discovery of novel synthetic lethal targets and vulnerabilities accompanying patient-specific copy number changes. Using this target identification strategy, we showed that chr8p deletion sensitizes tumor cells to targeting of the reactive oxygen sanitizing enzyme Nudix hydrolase 17 (NUDT17)."

            "Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer.  However, mechanisms underlying metabolic reprogramming and how altered metabolism in turn enhances tumorigenicity are poorly understood.  Here, we report that arginine levels are elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) despite reduced expression of arginine synthesis genes, in murine and patient tumors.  Tumor cells accumulate high levels of arginine due to increased uptake and reduced arginine-to-polyamine conversion.  Importantly, the high levels of arginine promote tumor formation via further metabolic reprogramming, including changes in glucose, amino acid, nucleotide, and fatty acid metabolism.  Mechanistically, arginine binds RNA-binding motif protein 39 (RBM39) to control expression of metabolic genes.  RBM39-mediated upregulation of asparagine synthesis leads to enhanced arginine uptake, creating a positive feedback loop to sustain high arginine levels and oncogenic metabolism.  Thus, arginine is a second messenger-like molecule that reprograms metabolism to promote tumor growth."

Accurate Long-read transcriptome sequencing at single-cell level is required to decipher the spectrum of protein expressions in mammalian organisms. In this report, we developed a synthetic long-read single-cell sequencing technology based on LOOPseq technique. We applied this technology to analyze 447 transcriptomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and benign liver from an individual. Through Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) analysis, we identified a panel of mutation mRNA isoforms highly specific to HCC cells. The evolution pathways that led to the hyper-mutation clusters in single human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules were identified. Novel fusion transcripts were detected. The combination of gene expressions, fusion gene transcripts, and mutation gene expressions significantly improved the classification of liver cancer cells versus benign hepatocytes. In conclusion, LOOPseq single-cell technology may hold promise to provide a new level of precision analysis on the mammalian transcriptome."

            "Earlier studies linked sorafenib effectiveness to induction of ferroptosis. Herein we demonstrate sorafenib and mTKIs downregulate DDX5 in vitro and in vivo. To understand the effect of DDX5 downregulation, we compared TCGA-derived HCCs expressing low vs. high DDX5 focusing on ferroptosis-related genes. Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key ferroptosis regulator, was significantly overexpressed in DDX5LOW HCCs. Importantly, DDX5-knockdown (DDX5KD) HCC cell lines lacked lipid peroxidation by GPX4 inhibition, indicating DDX5 downregulation suppresses ferroptosis. RNAseq analyses comparing wild type vs. DDX5KD cells in the presence or absence of sorafenib, identified a unique set of genes repressed by DDX5 and upregulated by sorafenib. This set significantly overlaps genes from Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways, including NF-\u03baB inducing Kinase required for non-canonical NF-\u03baB activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of these pathways in combination with sorafenib reduced DDX5KD cell viability. Mechanistically, sorafenib-mediated NF-\u03baB activation induced NRF2 transcription, while DDX5KD extended NRF2 half/life by stabilizing p62/SQSTM1, leading to enhanced expression of GPX4 and ferroptosis escape. Conclusion: Sorafenib/mTKI-mediated DDX5 downregulation results in adaptive mTKI resistance by enhancing NRF2 expression, leading to ferroptosis escape. We propose inhibition of the pathways leading to NRF2 expression will enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of sorafenib/mTKIs."

Taken together, this study demonstrated plasma and myeloid cell-mediated immunosuppression in HCC and CRLM, suggesting that selectively modulating primary or secondary tumor-related immunosuppressive regulatory networks might reprogram the microenvironment and provide an immunotherapeutic strategy for treating liver cancer."

            "The transcriptional coactivators YAP/TAZ are the critical downstream regulators of the Hippo pathway that regulate gene expression in response to changes in pathway activity, mainly by binding to TEAD transcription factors. Uncontrolled transcriptional output of YAP/TAZ can lead to rapid induction of aggressive tumor growth. AP-1 is a dimeric basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor complex with JUN and FOS proteins being the most abundant members of this family. Unlike FOS, JUN can also form homodimers, but in the cell, JUN presumably preferentially forms heterodimers with members of the FOS family, which act as potent transcriptional activators. Previous studies identified substantial co-occupancy of YAP/TAZ and AP-1 at genomic sites, and they demonstrated that JUN/FOS heterodimers cooperate with the YAP/TAZ and TEAD transcription factors to drive YAP/TAZ target gene expression. Here, we now elucidate a negative feedback mechanism in which high YAP activity is restrained by the recruitment of homodimeric JUN::JUN/NCOR1 repressor complexes and show that this noncanonical JUN function is part of a tumor suppressor mechanism in the liver."

            "Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer.  However, mechanisms underlying metabolic reprogramming and how altered metabolism in turn enhances tumorigenicity are poorly understood.  Here, we report that arginine levels are elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) despite reduced expression of arginine synthesis genes, in murine and patient tumors.  Tumor cells accumulate high levels of arginine due to increased uptake and reduced arginine-to-polyamine conversion.  Importantly, the high levels of arginine promote tumor formation via further metabolic reprogramming, including changes in glucose, amino acid, nucleotide, and fatty acid metabolism.  Mechanistically, arginine binds RNA-binding motif protein 39 (RBM39) to control expression of metabolic genes.  RBM39-mediated upregulation of asparagine synthesis leads to enhanced arginine uptake, creating a positive feedback loop to sustain high arginine levels and oncogenic metabolism.  Thus, arginine is a second messenger-like molecule that reprograms metabolism to promote tumor growth."

Accurate Long-read transcriptome sequencing at single-cell level is required to decipher the spectrum of protein expressions in mammalian organisms. In this report, we developed a synthetic long-read single-cell sequencing technology based on LOOPseq technique. We applied this technology to analyze 447 transcriptomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and benign liver from an individual. Through Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) analysis, we identified a panel of mutation mRNA isoforms highly specific to HCC cells. The evolution pathways that led to the hyper-mutation clusters in single human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules were identified. Novel fusion transcripts were detected. The combination of gene expressions, fusion gene transcripts, and mutation gene expressions significantly improved the classification of liver cancer cells versus benign hepatocytes. In conclusion, LOOPseq single-cell technology may hold promise to provide a new level of precision analysis on the mammalian transcriptome."

Additionally, hepatocytes showed a high degree of fat droplet accumulation during excessive alcohol consumption and metabolic syndrome. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in fat droplet formation remain unknown. This study used an in vitro fatty liver formation model of the human liver cancer cell line HepG2 to comprehensively search for fat droplet formation-related genes whose expression changes during fat droplet formation. Microarray analysis with extracted total RNA determined the genes that are involved in fat droplet formation and confirmed their expression by real-time polymerase chain reaction after culturing HepG2 cells in a culture medium containing 0, 50, 200, and 500 \u03bcM of oleic acid for 24 h. The results revealed 142 genes demonstrating increased expressions by >2.0 fold with oleic acid treatment and 426 genes demonstrating decreased expressions. Perilipin 2 (PLIN2) was estimated as the gene most closely associated with fatty liver. Lipid droplet formation in HepG2 upregulated PLIN2 in an oleic acid-treated concentration-dependent manner. These results indicate the involvement of genes in oleate treatment-induced lipid droplet formation in HepG2, particularly PLIN2 may play an important role."

        "summary": [
            "Liver cancer claims over 800,000 human deaths each year. Liver cancer is notoriously refractory to conventional therapeutics. Further insight into the etiology carries promise for innovative diagnostics and therapeutics. Tumor progression is governed by interplay between tumor promoting genes and suppressor genes. BRD4, an acetyl-lysine binding protein, plays a critical role in development and human diseases. In many cancer types, BRD4 is overexpressed and promotes activation of a pro-tumor gene network. But the underlying mechanism for BRD4 overexpression remains elusive. As BRD4 has risen as a promising therapeutic target, to understand the mechanism regulating BRD4 protein level will shed insight into BRD4-targeting therapeutics. In this study, we find BRD4 protein level in liver cancer is significantly regulated by P53, the most frequently dysregulated tumor suppressor. We identify a strong negative correlation between protein levels of P53 and BRD4 in liver cancer. We then show P53 promotes BRD4 protein degradation. Mechanistically, P53 represses the transcription of USP1, a deubiquitinase, through P21-RB. We show USP1 is a deubiquitinase of BRD4, which increases its stability. We show the pro-tumor role of USP1 is partially mediated by BRD4 and the USP1-BRD4 axis upholds expression of a group of cancer-related genes. In summary, we identify a functional P53-P21-RB-USP1-BRD4 axis in liver cancer."

            "Hexokinases (HKs), a group of enzymes catalyzing the first step of glycolysis, have been shown to play important roles in liver metabolism and tumorigenesis. Our recent studies identified HKDC1 as a top candidate associated with liver cancer metastasis. We aimed to compare its cell type specificity with other HKs upregulated in liver cancer and investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying its involvement in liver cancer metastasis. We found that, compared to HK1 and HK2, the other two commonly upregulated HKs in liver cancer, HKDC1 was most strongly associated with the metastasis potential of tumors and organoids derived from two liver cancer mouse models we previously established. RNA in situ hybridization and single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed that HKDC1 was specifically upregulated in malignant cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patient tumors, whereas HK1 and HK2 were widespread across various tumor microenvironment lineages. An unbiased metabolomic profiling demonstrated that HKDC1 overexpression in HCC cells led to metabolic alterations distinct from those from HK1 and HK2 overexpression, with HKDC1 particularly impacting the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. HKDC1 was prometastatic in HCC orthotopic and tail vein injection mouse models. Molecularly, HKDC1 was induced by hypoxia and bound to glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 to stabilize \u03b2-catenin, leading to enhanced stemness of HCC cells. Overall, our findings underscore HKDC1 as a prometastatic HK specifically expressed in the malignant compartment of primary liver tumors, thereby providing a mechanistic basis for targeting this enzyme in advanced liver cancer."

            "Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a liver cancer of adolescents and young adults defined by fusion of the DNAJB1 heat shock protein and protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunit (DNAJB1-PRKACA). The resulting chimeric protein has increased kinase activity and is essential for FLC xenograft growth. However, the critical oncogenic pathways controlled by DNAJB1-PRKACA have not been defined. Here, we explored this question by studying patient-derived FLC models and engineered systems and analyzing patient samples. We show that the core function of DNAJB1-PRKACA is the direct phosphorylation and inactivation of the Salt-inducible kinases. This leads to deregulation of the CRTC2 co-activator and p300 acetyltransferase, resulting in transcriptional reprogramming and global increases in histone acetylation necessary for malignant growth. Our studies establish a central oncogenic mechanism of DNAJB1-PRKACA and suggest opportunities for therapeutic targeting of CRTC2/p300 in FLC. Notably, these findings link this signature fusion oncoprotein of a rare cancer type to more common cancer gene alterations involving the STK11 tumor suppressor and GNAS oncogene, which also function via SIK suppression."

Here, we demonstrated that B cells are an important regulator in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) microenvironments. B cells displayed distinct developmental trajectories in HCC and CRLM. Single-cell analysis revealed that IgG+ plasma cells preferentially accumulated in HCC while IgA+ plasma cells were preferentially enriched in CRLM. Mechanistically, IgG+ plasma cells in HCC were recruited by tumor-associated macrophages via the CXCR3-CXCL10 axis, whereas IgA+ plasma cells in CRLM were recruited by metastatic tumor cells via CCR10-CCL28 signaling. Functionally, IgG+ plasma cells preferentially promoted pro-tumorigenic macrophages formation in HCC, and IgA+ plasma cells preferentially induced granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells activation in CRLM. Clinically, increased infiltration of IgG+ plasma cells and macrophages in HCC was correlated to worse survival, while increased intratumoral IgA+ plasma cells and neutrophils in CRLM indicated poor prognosis. Taken together, this study demonstrated plasma and myeloid cell-mediated immunosuppression in HCC and CRLM, suggesting that selectively modulating primary or secondary tumor-related immunosuppressive regulatory networks might reprogram the microenvironment and provide an immunotherapeutic strategy for treating liver cancer."

            "Recent studies have shown that high cell cycle activity negatively correlates with antitumor immunity in certain cancer types. However, a similar correlation has not been proven in liver cancer.We downloaded transcriptomic profiles of TCGA-LIHC (the cancer genome atlas-liver hepatocellular carcinoma) and assessed the cell cycle distribution of samples using single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA), termed the cell cycle score (CCS). We obtained cell cycle-related differentially expressed prognostic genes and identified CENPA, CDC20 and CTSV using LASSO regression. We studied the effect of CTSV on clinical features and immune alterations in liver cancer based on TCGA-LIHC data. In vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to validate the role of CTSV in liver cancer using liver cancer cell lines and tissues.We found that the CCS closely correlated with the clinical features and prognosis of patients in TCGA-LIHC. Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), univariate Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression identified cathepsin V (CTSV) with prognostic significance in LIHC. Importantly, single-gene survival analysis of CTSV using microarray and sequencing data indicated that high levels of CTSV expression correlated with an unfavorable prognosis in various cancers. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that high CTSV expression closely correlated with decreased expression of metabolic genes and increased expression of cell cycle genes. Furthermore, difference and correlation analyses of the relationship between CTSV expression and immune infiltrates, determined using CIBERSORT and TIMER algorithms, revealed that CTSV expression correlated with macrophages and CD4+ T cells. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that knockdown of CTSV inhibited liver cancer cells proliferation. Immunohistochemical staining showed that high CTSV expression correlated with macrophage infiltration in liver cancer tissues, predicted a poor prognosis, and may serve as a biomarker for HCC therapy.In conclusion, CTSV is a novel cell cycle prognostic gene that can affect HCC cells proliferation, and a potential biomarker for HCC therapy."

            "Here, we generated full-length single cell transcriptome data for ~9,000 cells from clinical samples of 11 liver cancer patients to delineate cellular relationships of diverse malignant, immune and stromal cells. We identified an immunomodulatory fibroblast population, FAP+CCL19+CCL21+ CAFs, that expressed signatures of fibroblastic reticular cells and was associated with favorable prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These CAFs exhibited the potential to recruit NK cells and regulate tumor-associated macrophages, and appeared to be regulated by CXCL12+ endothelial cells in tumors through specific ligand-receptor interaction. Further, we uncovered clonal HBV integration events enriched in tumor cells, and trajectory analysis on tumor cells with clonal HBV integration events revealed that hepatoblast-like cells differentiated into a terminal state with high expression of an immune-resistance program. The intercellular crosstalks between CAFs and cancer cells, macrophages, and NK cells, combined with HBV-based lineage tracing, provide a better understanding for functional roles of CAFs in the HCC microenvironment, and the relationship between HBV integration and liver malignancies."

            "The transcriptional coactivators YAP/TAZ are the critical downstream regulators of the Hippo pathway that regulate gene expression in response to changes in pathway activity, mainly by binding to TEAD transcription factors. Uncontrolled transcriptional output of YAP/TAZ can lead to rapid induction of aggressive tumor growth. AP-1 is a dimeric basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor complex with JUN and FOS proteins being the most abundant members of this family. Unlike FOS, JUN can also form homodimers, but in the cell, JUN presumably preferentially forms heterodimers with members of the FOS family, which act as potent transcriptional activators. Previous studies identified substantial co-occupancy of YAP/TAZ and AP-1 at genomic sites, and they demonstrated that JUN/FOS heterodimers cooperate with the YAP/TAZ and TEAD transcription factors to drive YAP/TAZ target gene expression. Here, we now elucidate a negative feedback mechanism in which high YAP activity is restrained by the recruitment of homodimeric JUN::JUN/NCOR1 repressor complexes and show that this noncanonical JUN function is part of a tumor suppressor mechanism in the liver."

            "The clinical management of liver cancer is challenged by the reduced availability of drugs targeting key signaling pathways and their modest benefits to patients. Senescence induction may represent a strategy for cancer treatment, especially as a combination therapy. The posttranslational modification (PTM) of proteins critically influences many biological processes, including gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, tumor progression, and drug resistance. Herein, we newly discovered that the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Human antigen R (HuR), a hub in liver cancer, is SUMOylated in the tumor sections of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in contrast to the surrounding tissue, as well as in human cell line and mouse models of the disease. SUMOylation of HuR promotes major cancer hallmarks, namely proliferation and invasion, whereas the absence of HuR SUMOylation results in a senescent phenotype with dysfunctional mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mechanistically, SUMOylation induces a structural rearrangement of the RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that modulates HuR binding affinity to its target mRNAs further modifying the transcriptomic profile towards hepatic tumor progression."

            "Large-scale chromosomal aberrations are prevalent in human cancer but their functional effects remain poorly understood. We describe the establishment of chromosome-engineered hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines using a dual guided CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing strategy. A mega base-sized region on chromosome 8p (chr8p) was heterozygously deleted mimicking a frequently observed copy number alteration (CNA) of solid tumors. Using this unique model system, we delineated the functional consequences of chr8p loss and its impact on metastatic behavior and patient survival. We found that metastasis associated genes on chr8p act in concert to induce an aggressive and invasive phenotype characteristic for chr8p deleted tumors. The conjunction of engineered  chromosome-scale CNAs and genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 viability screenings served as a powerful tool for the discovery of novel synthetic lethal targets and vulnerabilities accompanying patient-specific copy number changes. Using this target identification strategy, we showed that chr8p deletion sensitizes tumor cells to targeting of the reactive oxygen sanitizing enzyme Nudix hydrolase 17 (NUDT17)."

We identified an immunomodulatory fibroblast population, FAP+CCL19+CCL21+ CAFs, that expressed signatures of fibroblastic reticular cells and was associated with favorable prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These CAFs exhibited the potential to recruit NK cells and regulate tumor-associated macrophages, and appeared to be regulated by CXCL12+ endothelial cells in tumors through specific ligand-receptor interaction. Further, we uncovered clonal HBV integration events enriched in tumor cells, and trajectory analysis on tumor cells with clonal HBV integration events revealed that hepatoblast-like cells differentiated into a terminal state with high expression of an immune-resistance program. The intercellular crosstalks between CAFs and cancer cells, macrophages, and NK cells, combined with HBV-based lineage tracing, provide a better understanding for functional roles of CAFs in the HCC microenvironment, and the relationship between HBV integration and liver malignancies."

        "summary": [
            "Earlier studies linked sorafenib effectiveness to induction of ferroptosis. Herein we demonstrate sorafenib and mTKIs downregulate DDX5 in vitro and in vivo. To understand the effect of DDX5 downregulation, we compared TCGA-derived HCCs expressing low vs. high DDX5 focusing on ferroptosis-related genes. Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key ferroptosis regulator, was significantly overexpressed in DDX5LOW HCCs. Importantly, DDX5-knockdown (DDX5KD) HCC cell lines lacked lipid peroxidation by GPX4 inhibition, indicating DDX5 downregulation suppresses ferroptosis. RNAseq analyses comparing wild type vs. DDX5KD cells in the presence or absence of sorafenib, identified a unique set of genes repressed by DDX5 and upregulated by sorafenib. This set significantly overlaps genes from Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways, including NF-\u03baB inducing Kinase required for non-canonical NF-\u03baB activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of these pathways in combination with sorafenib reduced DDX5KD cell viability. Mechanistically, sorafenib-mediated NF-\u03baB activation induced NRF2 transcription, while DDX5KD extended NRF2 half/life by stabilizing p62/SQSTM1, leading to enhanced expression of GPX4 and ferroptosis escape. Conclusion: Sorafenib/mTKI-mediated DDX5 downregulation results in adaptive mTKI resistance by enhancing NRF2 expression, leading to ferroptosis escape. We propose inhibition of the pathways leading to NRF2 expression will enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of sorafenib/mTKIs."

            "Liver cancer is a devastating disease characterized by its molecular complexity and the insidious behavior of liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs), which drive the metastasis and recurrence. However, the heterogeneity of molecular markers of LCSCs has hindered the development of effective methods to isolate them. This study introduced a pioneering approach to isolate and culture LCSCs from primary tumor tissues, leveraging mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) as a feeder cell to provide the niche in conjunction with using defined medium, which stands in stark contrast to traditional techniques, and promised to revolutionize our understanding of LCSCs. Total seventeen cell strains were directly isolated from 24 patients\u2019 tissues without sorting, seven of which could be maintained long-term culture as colony growth on MEFs, which is unique characteristics of stem cells. Cloned cells formed a round packed morphology on MEFs and could be cryopreserved and re-cultured. Even 10 of cloned cells could form xenografts of human liver cancers in immunodeficient mice, indicating high tumorigenicity. Thus, cloned cells could be designated as liver cancer stem cells. Our further investigation found that reported putative liver cancer stem cell markers were all expressed in cloned cells, and stemness of cancer stem cells could well maintained under our developed culture conditions when compared to those under traditional suspension conditions. Furthermore, our findings revealed a distinct molecular landscape within hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), pinpointing a C2 subtype with profound implications for personalized medicine and the development of targeted therapies. By illuminating the unique responses of this subtype to chemotherapeutic agents, our research not only advances the frontiers of liver cancer biology but also charts a course for more effective, patient-specific treatment strategies."

            "Recent studies have indicated a multi-directional seeding of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Apart from seeding to distant tissues (cancer metastases), CTCs can also reinfiltrate and colonize already established tumors. This process of \u201ctumor self-seeding\u201d provides new insights into the dynamics of tumor progression, and has been indicated to promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, and invasion. Thus, therapeutic targeting of tumor self-seeded cells (TSCs) may provide effective strategies for preventing tumor progression. However, TSCs have not been well identified and characterized due to unsuitable animal models. Therefore, this study aims to develop a novel animal model to recapitulate the process of tumor self-seeding and characterize the transcriptional and functional profiles of TSCs in liver cancer. Using our tumor self-seeding model, TSCs, primary tumor cells (PCs), and CTCs were identified and isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). RNA sequencing of the purified cells identified TSCs as a subpopulation of PCs. Further analyses showed that TSCs were enriched with gene sets of cancer metastasis and invasiveness, suggesting TSCs may provide novel cell targets with diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic potential."

            "The clinical management of liver cancer is challenged by the reduced availability of drugs targeting key signaling pathways and their modest benefits to patients. Senescence induction may represent a strategy for cancer treatment, especially as a combination therapy. The posttranslational modification (PTM) of proteins critically influences many biological processes, including gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, tumor progression, and drug resistance. Herein, we newly discovered that the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Human antigen R (HuR), a hub in liver cancer, is SUMOylated in the tumor sections of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in contrast to the surrounding tissue, as well as in human cell line and mouse models of the disease. SUMOylation of HuR promotes major cancer hallmarks, namely proliferation and invasion, whereas the absence of HuR SUMOylation results in a senescent phenotype with dysfunctional mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mechanistically, SUMOylation induces a structural rearrangement of the RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that modulates HuR binding affinity to its target mRNAs further modifying the transcriptomic profile towards hepatic tumor progression."

            "Hexokinases (HKs), a group of enzymes catalyzing the first step of glycolysis, have been shown to play important roles in liver metabolism and tumorigenesis. Our recent studies identified HKDC1 as a top candidate associated with liver cancer metastasis. We aimed to compare its cell type specificity with other HKs upregulated in liver cancer and investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying its involvement in liver cancer metastasis. We found that, compared to HK1 and HK2, the other two commonly upregulated HKs in liver cancer, HKDC1 was most strongly associated with the metastasis potential of tumors and organoids derived from two liver cancer mouse models we previously established. RNA in situ hybridization and single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed that HKDC1 was specifically upregulated in malignant cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patient tumors, whereas HK1 and HK2 were widespread across various tumor microenvironment lineages. An unbiased metabolomic profiling demonstrated that HKDC1 overexpression in HCC cells led to metabolic alterations distinct from those from HK1 and HK2 overexpression, with HKDC1 particularly impacting the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. HKDC1 was prometastatic in HCC orthotopic and tail vein injection mouse models. Molecularly, HKDC1 was induced by hypoxia and bound to glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 to stabilize \u03b2-catenin, leading to enhanced stemness of HCC cells. Overall, our findings underscore HKDC1 as a prometastatic HK specifically expressed in the malignant compartment of primary liver tumors, thereby providing a mechanistic basis for targeting this enzyme in advanced liver cancer."

Here, we demonstrated that B cells are an important regulator in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) microenvironments. B cells displayed distinct developmental trajectories in HCC and CRLM. Single-cell analysis revealed that IgG+ plasma cells preferentially accumulated in HCC while IgA+ plasma cells were preferentially enriched in CRLM. Mechanistically, IgG+ plasma cells in HCC were recruited by tumor-associated macrophages via the CXCR3-CXCL10 axis, whereas IgA+ plasma cells in CRLM were recruited by metastatic tumor cells via CCR10-CCL28 signaling. Functionally, IgG+ plasma cells preferentially promoted pro-tumorigenic macrophages formation in HCC, and IgA+ plasma cells preferentially induced granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells activation in CRLM. Clinically, increased infiltration of IgG+ plasma cells and macrophages in HCC was correlated to worse survival, while increased intratumoral IgA+ plasma cells and neutrophils in CRLM indicated poor prognosis. Taken together, this study demonstrated plasma and myeloid cell-mediated immunosuppression in HCC and CRLM, suggesting that selectively modulating primary or secondary tumor-related immunosuppressive regulatory networks might reprogram the microenvironment and provide an immunotherapeutic strategy for treating liver cancer."
