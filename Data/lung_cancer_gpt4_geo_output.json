Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity\u2014as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics. Collectively, our findings highlight conserved developmental trajectories between ONB and SCLC subtypes with significant implications for ONB classification and treatment."}}

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.  Conclusion: This study proposes a miRNA-based biomarker classifier for SCLC that considers clinical demographics with specific cut offs to inform SCLC diagnosis."}}

Identification of potential targets suitable for drug development using high-throughput methods is still lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to analyze expression profiles of mRNA and miRNA in LUSC, aiming to identify the key molecules associated with tumorigenesis and prognosis (overall survival; OS). We performed differential gene expression analysis, pathway enrichment analysis and gene ontology analysis on RNA-seq data obtained from 23 FFPE tumor samples and 3 FFPE healthy individuals. TCGA LUSC and GTEx healthy donors\u2019 cohorts were used for validation. We identified 1133 up-regulated and 644 down-regulated genes, common for both cohorts. The most significant up-regulated genes were involved in cell-cycle regulation pathways, while down-regulated genes predominately belonged to immune-related pathways. Survival analysis performed on selected genes, commonly dysregulated in both cohorts and performed only on non-metastatic patients, identified novel prognostic biomarkers associated with OS in early-stage LUSC patients (HOXC4-worse OS, p=0.0001; LILRA5-better OS, p=0.0086). In total, 50 differentially expressed genes are correlated with patients\u2019 OS. Aiming to get better insight into the profile of the tumor microenvironment, we estimated levels of immune-cells infiltration in LUSC and identified 4 subtypes based on immune-cell infiltration levels. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built based on differentially expressed genes, and PPI modules and hub-genes were identified.

{"BioSample": {"title": ["Transcripts related to lung cancer disease in blood samples obtained from diagnostic and pre-diagnostic cohorts"], "summary": ["Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls).

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."}}

{"BioSample": {"title": ["Protein expression from paired biopsies from a patient with METex14 skiping non-small cell lung cancer before and after treatment with neoadjuvant tepotinib (42 days)"], "summary": ["Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively).

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

We observed increased fractions of exhausted CD8+ T cells, CCL18+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and LAMP3+ dendritic cells (DCs) in the immune component of NSCLC with COPD compared with the findings in NSCLC without COPD.

{"BioSample": {"title": ["Spatially resolved whole-transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of lung cancer and immune-microenvironment according to PD-L1 expression"], "summary": ["The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TCs) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes.

{"BioSample": {"title": ["Protein expression from paired biopsies from a patient with METex14 skiping non-small cell lung cancer before and after treatment with neoadjuvant tepotinib (42 days)"], "summary": ["Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

{"BioSample": {"title": ["Gene expression from paired biopsies from a patient with METex14 skiping non-small cell lung cancer before and after treatment with neoadjuvant tepotinib (42 days)"], "summary": ["Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.

{"BioSample": {"title": ["Gene expression from paired biopsies from a patient with METex14 skiping non-small cell lung cancer before and after treatment with neoadjuvant tepotinib (42 days)"], "summary": ["Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."}}

{"BioSample": {"title": ["Gene expression from paired biopsies from a patient with METex14 skiping non-small cell lung cancer before and after treatment with neoadjuvant tepotinib (42 days)"], "summary": ["Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

{"BioSample": {"title": ["Protein expression from paired biopsies from a patient with METex14 skiping non-small cell lung cancer before and after treatment with neoadjuvant tepotinib (42 days)"], "summary": ["Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration.

Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response.

Collectively, our findings highlight conserved developmental trajectories between ONB and SCLC subtypes with significant implications for ONB classification and treatment."}}

Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted.

The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

We show that lung carcinoma cells devoid of expression of the gene C22orf46 exhibit increased susceptibility to T cell induced apoptosis and genotoxic stress mediated by chemotherapeutic agents. We present data showing that C22orf46, previously annotated as a non-coding gene, encodes an expressed nucleolar protein with remote homologies to the BH domain-containing Bcl-2 family and propose to name this protein Tumor Apoptosis Associated Protein 1 (TAAP1). Collectively, our findings establish TAAP1/C22orf46 as a pro-survival oncogene with possible implications to therapy"}}

We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

{"BioSample": {"title": ["Protein expression from paired biopsies from a patient with METex14 skiping non-small cell lung cancer before and after treatment with neoadjuvant tepotinib (42 days)"], "summary": ["Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

{"BioSample": {"title": ["A plasma miRNA-based classifier for small cell lung cancer diagnosis [miRNA-Seq]"], "summary": ["Objectives: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and challenging diagnosis. Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.

{"BioSample": {"title": ["Protein expression from paired biopsies from a patient with METex14 skiping non-small cell lung cancer before and after treatment with neoadjuvant tepotinib (42 days)"], "summary": ["Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample.

Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

{"BioSample": {"title": ["Protein expression from paired biopsies from a patient with METex14 skiping non-small cell lung cancer before and after treatment with neoadjuvant tepotinib (42 days)"], "summary": ["Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

{"BioSample": {"title": ["Protein expression from paired biopsies from a patient with METex14 skiping non-small cell lung cancer before and after treatment with neoadjuvant tepotinib (42 days)"], "summary": ["Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

{"BioSample": {"title": ["Protein expression from paired biopsies from a patient with METex14 skiping non-small cell lung cancer before and after treatment with neoadjuvant tepotinib (42 days)"], "summary": ["Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

{"BioSample": {"title": ["Gene expression from paired biopsies from a patient with METex14 skiping non-small cell lung cancer before and after treatment with neoadjuvant tepotinib (42 days)"], "summary": ["Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

{"BioSample": {"title": ["Protein expression from paired biopsies from a patient with METex14 skiping non-small cell lung cancer before and after treatment with neoadjuvant tepotinib (42 days)"], "summary": ["Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

{"BioSample": {"title": ["Protein expression from paired biopsies from a patient with METex14 skiping non-small cell lung cancer before and after treatment with neoadjuvant tepotinib (42 days)"], "summary": ["Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted.

{"BioSample": {"title": ["Protein expression from paired biopsies from a patient with METex14 skiping non-small cell lung cancer before and after treatment with neoadjuvant tepotinib (42 days)"], "summary": ["Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

{"BioSample": {"title": ["Protein expression from paired biopsies from a patient with METex14 skiping non-small cell lung cancer before and after treatment with neoadjuvant tepotinib (42 days)"], "summary": ["Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

{"BioSample": {"title": ["Transcripts related to lung cancer disease in blood samples obtained from diagnostic and pre-diagnostic cohorts"], "summary": ["Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively).

{"BioSample": {"title": ["Protein expression from paired biopsies from a patient with METex14 skiping non-small cell lung cancer before and after treatment with neoadjuvant tepotinib (42 days)"], "summary": ["Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively).

{"BioSample": {"title": ["Improved lung cancer classification by employing diverse molecular features of microRNAs"], "summary": ["Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples.
