            "The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TCs) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer. Our study suggests that cfDNA 5hmC analysis is a minimally invasive, innovative strategy for guiding treatment selection in lung cancer patients."

            "Squamous cell lung cancer (LUSC) is a frequently diagnosed histological subtype of lung malignancy associated with high mortality due to limited number of treatment options. Identification of potential targets suitable for drug development using high-throughput methods is still lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to analyze expression profiles of mRNA and miRNA in LUSC, aiming to identify the key molecules associated with tumorigenesis and prognosis (overall survival; OS). We performed differential gene expression analysis, pathway enrichment analysis and gene ontology analysis on RNA-seq data obtained from 23 FFPE tumor samples and 3 FFPE healthy individuals. TCGA LUSC and GTEx healthy donors\u2019 cohorts were used for validation. We identified 1133 up-regulated and 644 down-regulated genes, common for both cohorts. The most significant up-regulated genes were involved in cell-cycle regulation pathways, while down-regulated genes predominately belonged to immune-related pathways. Survival analysis performed on selected genes, commonly dysregulated in both cohorts and performed only on non-metastatic patients, identified novel prognostic biomarkers associated with OS in early-stage LUSC patients (HOXC4-worse OS, p=0.0001; LILRA5-better OS, p=0.0086). In total, 50 differentially expressed genes are correlated with patients\u2019 OS. Aiming to get better insight into the profile of the tumor microenvironment, we estimated levels of immune-cells infiltration in LUSC and identified 4 subtypes based on immune-cell infiltration levels. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built based on differentially expressed genes, and PPI modules and hub-genes were identified. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was conducted to identify significant modules and hub-genes in correlation to clinical traits. Differential analysis on miRNA-Seq data, obtained from 16 tumor and 4 healthy tissue samples, was conducted as well. 75 up-regulated and 47 down-regulated miRNAs were identified. Further, targets of differentially expressed miRNA were identified, following gene ontology analysis and miRNA-mRNA networks construction."

SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.  Conclusion: This study proposes a miRNA-based biomarker classifier for SCLC that considers clinical demographics with specific cut offs to inform SCLC diagnosis."

            "Squamous cell lung cancer (LUSC) is a frequently diagnosed histological subtype of lung malignancy associated with high mortality due to limited number of treatment options. Identification of potential targets suitable for drug development using high-throughput methods is still lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to analyze expression profiles of mRNA and miRNA in LUSC, aiming to identify the key molecules associated with tumorigenesis and prognosis (overall survival; OS). We performed differential gene expression analysis, pathway enrichment analysis and gene ontology analysis on RNA-seq data obtained from 23 FFPE tumor samples and 3 FFPE healthy individuals. TCGA LUSC and GTEx healthy donors\u2019 cohorts were used for validation. We identified 1133 up-regulated and 644 down-regulated genes, common for both cohorts. The most significant up-regulated genes were involved in cell-cycle regulation pathways, while down-regulated genes predominately belonged to immune-related pathways. Survival analysis performed on selected genes, commonly dysregulated in both cohorts and performed only on non-metastatic patients, identified novel prognostic biomarkers associated with OS in early-stage LUSC patients (HOXC4-worse OS, p=0.0001; LILRA5-better OS, p=0.0086). In total, 50 differentially expressed genes are correlated with patients\u2019 OS. Aiming to get better insight into the profile of the tumor microenvironment, we estimated levels of immune-cells infiltration in LUSC and identified 4 subtypes based on immune-cell infiltration levels. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built based on differentially expressed genes, and PPI modules and hub-genes were identified. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was conducted to identify significant modules and hub-genes in correlation to clinical traits. Differential analysis on miRNA-Seq data, obtained from 16 tumor and 4 healthy tissue samples, was conducted as well. 75 up-regulated and 47 down-regulated miRNAs were identified. Further, targets of differentially expressed miRNA were identified, following gene ontology analysis and miRNA-mRNA networks construction."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

Depletion of Pcdh7 reduces lung tumor burden and prolongs survival in mouse models of high-grade NSCLC, demonstrating that this protein is an actionable therapeutic target. Here we report the development and characterization of high affinity anti-PCDH7 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that inhibit downstream MAPK pathway activation and suppress tumor growth in multiple mouse models, including KRAS- and EGFR-mutant models. A lead mAb (mAb7) sensitized tumors to the FDA-approved MEK inhibitor trametinib. Moreover, the humanized mAb7-IgG1 exhibited antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and Fc-mediated immune effector killing of tumor cells in vivo.

We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer. Our study suggests that cfDNA 5hmC analysis is a minimally invasive, innovative strategy for guiding treatment selection in lung cancer patients."

The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

However, the genetic mechanisms and target genes underlying these loci are largely unknown, as most risk-associated-variants might regulate gene expression in a context-specific manner. Here, we generated a barcode-shared multiome (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map) of 117,911 human lung cells from ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes. Our multiome dataset identified lung cancer susceptibility genes that were not detected in previous tissue- or cell-line-based approaches and further revealed the cell types and contexts where the susceptibility genes are functional, including the interplay of epithelial and immune cell types even in a single locus."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer. Our study suggests that cfDNA 5hmC analysis is a minimally invasive, innovative strategy for guiding treatment selection in lung cancer patients."

ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity\u2014as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics.

            "Objectives: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and challenging diagnosis. Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.  Conclusion: This study proposes a miRNA-based biomarker classifier for SCLC that considers clinical demographics with specific cut offs to inform SCLC diagnosis."

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "Objectives: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and challenging diagnosis. Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.  Conclusion: This study proposes a miRNA-based biomarker classifier for SCLC that considers clinical demographics with specific cut offs to inform SCLC diagnosis."

Metastasis to the brain is a severe complication for 45% of patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer that drastically reduces their quality of life and survival. Here, we demonstrate that genetic inhibition of S100A9, ALDH1A1, RAR, or pharmacological inhibition of the RA pathway using pan-RAR inhibitors significantly reduces brain relapse from osimertinib-refractory cancer cells. Our study has therefore revealed a novel S100A9-ALDH1A1-RA signaling axis in the EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells that drives osimertinib-refractory metastatic brain relapse and identified a potential vulnerability in lung cancer cells that can be therapeutically targeted to prolong progression-free survival in EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples. And the three miRNAs selected by DFL potentially represent an effective molecular signature for LUAD diagnosis."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer. Our study suggests that cfDNA 5hmC analysis is a minimally invasive, innovative strategy for guiding treatment selection in lung cancer patients."

            "Squamous cell lung cancer (LUSC) is a frequently diagnosed histological subtype of lung malignancy associated with high mortality due to limited number of treatment options. Identification of potential targets suitable for drug development using high-throughput methods is still lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to analyze expression profiles of mRNA and miRNA in LUSC, aiming to identify the key molecules associated with tumorigenesis and prognosis (overall survival; OS). We performed differential gene expression analysis, pathway enrichment analysis and gene ontology analysis on RNA-seq data obtained from 23 FFPE tumor samples and 3 FFPE healthy individuals. TCGA LUSC and GTEx healthy donors\u2019 cohorts were used for validation. We identified 1133 up-regulated and 644 down-regulated genes, common for both cohorts. The most significant up-regulated genes were involved in cell-cycle regulation pathways, while down-regulated genes predominately belonged to immune-related pathways. Survival analysis performed on selected genes, commonly dysregulated in both cohorts and performed only on non-metastatic patients, identified novel prognostic biomarkers associated with OS in early-stage LUSC patients (HOXC4-worse OS, p=0.0001; LILRA5-better OS, p=0.0086). In total, 50 differentially expressed genes are correlated with patients\u2019 OS. Aiming to get better insight into the profile of the tumor microenvironment, we estimated levels of immune-cells infiltration in LUSC and identified 4 subtypes based on immune-cell infiltration levels. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built based on differentially expressed genes, and PPI modules and hub-genes were identified. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was conducted to identify significant modules and hub-genes in correlation to clinical traits. Differential analysis on miRNA-Seq data, obtained from 16 tumor and 4 healthy tissue samples, was conducted as well. 75 up-regulated and 47 down-regulated miRNAs were identified. Further, targets of differentially expressed miRNA were identified, following gene ontology analysis and miRNA-mRNA networks construction."

            "The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TCs) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

For early-stage lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate for patients ranges from 80% in stage IA to 41% in stage IIIA, and many cases relapse after surgical resection. Currently, multiple clinical trials have manifested the encouraging efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC. However, the effect of immunotherapy in ultra early-stage NSCLC patients with micro-invasive or even pre-invasive lesions remains unclear.

            "Squamous cell lung cancer (LUSC) is a frequently diagnosed histological subtype of lung malignancy associated with high mortality due to limited number of treatment options. Identification of potential targets suitable for drug development using high-throughput methods is still lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to analyze expression profiles of mRNA and miRNA in LUSC, aiming to identify the key molecules associated with tumorigenesis and prognosis (overall survival; OS). We performed differential gene expression analysis, pathway enrichment analysis and gene ontology analysis on RNA-seq data obtained from 23 FFPE tumor samples and 3 FFPE healthy individuals. TCGA LUSC and GTEx healthy donors\u2019 cohorts were used for validation. We identified 1133 up-regulated and 644 down-regulated genes, common for both cohorts. The most significant up-regulated genes were involved in cell-cycle regulation pathways, while down-regulated genes predominately belonged to immune-related pathways. Survival analysis performed on selected genes, commonly dysregulated in both cohorts and performed only on non-metastatic patients, identified novel prognostic biomarkers associated with OS in early-stage LUSC patients (HOXC4-worse OS, p=0.0001; LILRA5-better OS, p=0.0086). In total, 50 differentially expressed genes are correlated with patients\u2019 OS. Aiming to get better insight into the profile of the tumor microenvironment, we estimated levels of immune-cells infiltration in LUSC and identified 4 subtypes based on immune-cell infiltration levels. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built based on differentially expressed genes, and PPI modules and hub-genes were identified. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was conducted to identify significant modules and hub-genes in correlation to clinical traits. Differential analysis on miRNA-Seq data, obtained from 16 tumor and 4 healthy tissue samples, was conducted as well. 75 up-regulated and 47 down-regulated miRNAs were identified. Further, targets of differentially expressed miRNA were identified, following gene ontology analysis and miRNA-mRNA networks construction."

            "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples. And the three miRNAs selected by DFL potentially represent an effective molecular signature for LUAD diagnosis."

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) can be classified into transcriptional subtypes with distinct degrees of neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation. Recent evidence supports plasticity among subtypes with a bias toward adoption of low-NE states during disease progression or upon acquired chemotherapy resistance. Here, we identify a role for SMARCA4, the catalytic subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, as a regulator of subtype shift in SCLC. SMARCA4 binds to gene loci encoding NE-lineage transcription factors ASCL1 and NEUROD1 and alters chromatin accessibility, suppressing NE programs. In parallel, SMARCA4 also controls REST, a known suppressor of the NE phenotype, by regulating SRRM4-dependent REST splicing. The SMARCA2/4 inhibitor FHD-286 induces loss of NE features and drives ERBB pathway activation in SCLC, rendering SCLC tumors sensitive to afatinib. This study nominates SMARCA4 as a key regulator of the NE state plasticity and defines a novel therapeutic strategy for SCLC."

            "Objectives: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and challenging diagnosis. Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.  Conclusion: This study proposes a miRNA-based biomarker classifier for SCLC that considers clinical demographics with specific cut offs to inform SCLC diagnosis."

            "Metastatic relapse from treatment failure has been a formidable challenge to finding a cure for EGFR-mutant lung cancer. Metastasis to the brain is a severe complication for 45% of patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer that drastically reduces their quality of life and survival. Here, we demonstrate that genetic inhibition of S100A9, ALDH1A1, RAR, or pharmacological inhibition of the RA pathway using pan-RAR inhibitors significantly reduces brain relapse from osimertinib-refractory cancer cells. Our study has therefore revealed a novel S100A9-ALDH1A1-RA signaling axis in the EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells that drives osimertinib-refractory metastatic brain relapse and identified a potential vulnerability in lung cancer cells that can be therapeutically targeted to prolong progression-free survival in EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients."

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "To better elucidate the complex interaction between COPD and NSCLC, we comprehensively characterized immune cell dynamics and transcriptome profiles of malignant cells in tumor tissues from NSCLC patients with COPD using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We observed increased fractions of exhausted CD8+ T cells, CCL18+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and LAMP3+ dendritic cells (DCs) in the immune component of NSCLC with COPD compared with the findings in NSCLC without COPD. Remarkably, a critical cluster of malignant cells from NSCLC with COPD samples, characterized by high expression of CD74, significantly exhibited an epithelial-immune dual signature and was associated with poor prognosis. Interestingly, we found that CD74 facilitated phosphorylation of MAPK/STAT3 to mediate PD-L1 expression and further suppressed CD8+ T cell function, triggering LC progression. Our study provides a comprehensive profiling of the multi-cellular ecosystem of NSCLC with coexisting COPD and reveals that CD74+ cancer cells are potential targets for immunotherapy."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TCs) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

For early-stage lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate for patients ranges from 80% in stage IA to 41% in stage IIIA, and many cases relapse after surgical resection. Currently, multiple clinical trials have manifested the encouraging efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC. However, the effect of immunotherapy in ultra early-stage NSCLC patients with micro-invasive or even pre-invasive lesions remains unclear.

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples. And the three miRNAs selected by DFL potentially represent an effective molecular signature for LUAD diagnosis."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity\u2014as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics.

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified over fifty genomic loci associated with lung cancer risk. However, the genetic mechanisms and target genes underlying these loci are largely unknown, as most risk-associated-variants might regulate gene expression in a context-specific manner. Here, we generated a barcode-shared multiome (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map) of 117,911 human lung cells from ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes. Our multiome dataset identified lung cancer susceptibility genes that were not detected in previous tissue- or cell-line-based approaches and further revealed the cell types and contexts where the susceptibility genes are functional, including the interplay of epithelial and immune cell types even in a single locus."

            "Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, of which approximately 85% are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced NSCLC was significantly prolonged with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis. For early-stage lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate for patients ranges from 80% in stage IA to 41% in stage IIIA, and many cases relapse after surgical resection. Currently, multiple clinical trials have manifested the encouraging efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC. However, the effect of immunotherapy in ultra early-stage NSCLC patients with micro-invasive or even pre-invasive lesions remains unclear.

We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "Squamous cell lung cancer (LUSC) is a frequently diagnosed histological subtype of lung malignancy associated with high mortality due to limited number of treatment options. Identification of potential targets suitable for drug development using high-throughput methods is still lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to analyze expression profiles of mRNA and miRNA in LUSC, aiming to identify the key molecules associated with tumorigenesis and prognosis (overall survival; OS). We performed differential gene expression analysis, pathway enrichment analysis and gene ontology analysis on RNA-seq data obtained from 23 FFPE tumor samples and 3 FFPE healthy individuals. TCGA LUSC and GTEx healthy donors\u2019 cohorts were used for validation. We identified 1133 up-regulated and 644 down-regulated genes, common for both cohorts. The most significant up-regulated genes were involved in cell-cycle regulation pathways, while down-regulated genes predominately belonged to immune-related pathways. Survival analysis performed on selected genes, commonly dysregulated in both cohorts and performed only on non-metastatic patients, identified novel prognostic biomarkers associated with OS in early-stage LUSC patients (HOXC4-worse OS, p=0.0001; LILRA5-better OS, p=0.0086). In total, 50 differentially expressed genes are correlated with patients\u2019 OS. Aiming to get better insight into the profile of the tumor microenvironment, we estimated levels of immune-cells infiltration in LUSC and identified 4 subtypes based on immune-cell infiltration levels. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built based on differentially expressed genes, and PPI modules and hub-genes were identified. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was conducted to identify significant modules and hub-genes in correlation to clinical traits. Differential analysis on miRNA-Seq data, obtained from 16 tumor and 4 healthy tissue samples, was conducted as well. 75 up-regulated and 47 down-regulated miRNAs were identified. Further, targets of differentially expressed miRNA were identified, following gene ontology analysis and miRNA-mRNA networks construction."

TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

            "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) drastically improve therapeutic outcomes for lung cancer, but accurate prediction of individual patient responses to ICIs remains a challenge. We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer. Our study suggests that cfDNA 5hmC analysis is a minimally invasive, innovative strategy for guiding treatment selection in lung cancer patients."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils.

            "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples. And the three miRNAs selected by DFL potentially represent an effective molecular signature for LUAD diagnosis."

            "To better elucidate the complex interaction between COPD and NSCLC, we comprehensively characterized immune cell dynamics and transcriptome profiles of malignant cells in tumor tissues from NSCLC patients with COPD using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We observed increased fractions of exhausted CD8+ T cells, CCL18+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and LAMP3+ dendritic cells (DCs) in the immune component of NSCLC with COPD compared with the findings in NSCLC without COPD. Remarkably, a critical cluster of malignant cells from NSCLC with COPD samples, characterized by high expression of CD74, significantly exhibited an epithelial-immune dual signature and was associated with poor prognosis. Interestingly, we found that CD74 facilitated phosphorylation of MAPK/STAT3 to mediate PD-L1 expression and further suppressed CD8+ T cell function, triggering LC progression. Our study provides a comprehensive profiling of the multi-cellular ecosystem of NSCLC with coexisting COPD and reveals that CD74+ cancer cells are potential targets for immunotherapy."

ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state.

Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "Objectives: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and challenging diagnosis. Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.  Conclusion: This study proposes a miRNA-based biomarker classifier for SCLC that considers clinical demographics with specific cut offs to inform SCLC diagnosis."

Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

            "This work describes a patient-derived tumoroid model (PDTs) to support precision medicine in lung oncology. The use of human adipose tissue-derived microvasculature and patient-derived PBMCs permits to achieve a physiologically relevant tumor-microenvironment in this 3D tumor model. This study involved ten patients at various stages of tumor progression. The vascularized, immune-infiltrated PDT model could be obtained within two weeks, matching the requirements of the therapeutic decision-making process. Histological and transcriptomic analyses confirmed that the main features from the original tumor were reproduced. The 3D tumor model could be used to determine the dynamics of response to antiangiogenic therapy and platinum-based chemotherapy. Antiangiogenic therapy showed a significant decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A expression, reflecting its therapeutic effect in the model. In an immune-infiltrated PDT model, chemotherapy showed the ability to decrease the levels of lymphocyte activation gene-3 protein (LAG-3), B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) and inhibitory receptors of T cells functions."

        "summary": [
            "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples. And the three miRNAs selected by DFL potentially represent an effective molecular signature for LUAD diagnosis."

            "Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, of which approximately 85% are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced NSCLC was significantly prolonged with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis. For early-stage lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate for patients ranges from 80% in stage IA to 41% in stage IIIA, and many cases relapse after surgical resection. Currently, multiple clinical trials have manifested the encouraging efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC. However, the effect of immunotherapy in ultra early-stage NSCLC patients with micro-invasive or even pre-invasive lesions remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the activity and safety of sintilimab on high-risk ground glass opacity lesions in multiple primary lung cancer patients."

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls).

High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils.

        "summary": [
            "Prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2 (PHD2) is one of the intracellular oxygen sensors that mediates proteasomal degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-\u03b1 via hydroxylation under normoxia. Because of its canonical function in the hypoxia signaling pathway, PHD2 is generally regarded as a tumor suppressor. However, the effects of PHD2 in tumorigenesis are not entirely dependent on HIF-\u03b1. Based on the data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we found that the expression of PHD2 is upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for approximately 80-85% of lung cancers, suggesting that PHD2 may play an important role in NSCLC. However, the function of PHD2 in NSCLC remains largely unknown. In this study, we established PHD2-deficient H1299 cells to investigate the function of PHD2 in NSCLC, and found that PHD2 suppressed cell proliferation and metabolism, but induced ROS levels in human NSCLC cells. Further results indicated that the function of PHD2 in NSCLC is dependent on its enzymatic activity and partially independent of HIF. Moreover, we performed RNA-seq and transcriptomics analysis to explore the underlying mechanisms, and identified some potential targets and pathways regulated by PHD2, apart from the canonical HIF-mediated hypoxia signaling pathway. These results provide some clues to uncover novel roles of PHD2 in lung cancer progression."

Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer. Our study suggests that cfDNA 5hmC analysis is a minimally invasive, innovative strategy for guiding treatment selection in lung cancer patients."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Histological and transcriptomic analyses confirmed that the main features from the original tumor were reproduced. The 3D tumor model could be used to determine the dynamics of response to antiangiogenic therapy and platinum-based chemotherapy. Antiangiogenic therapy showed a significant decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A expression, reflecting its therapeutic effect in the model.

            "The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TCs) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

            "Prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2 (PHD2) is one of the intracellular oxygen sensors that mediates proteasomal degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-\u03b1 via hydroxylation under normoxia. Because of its canonical function in the hypoxia signaling pathway, PHD2 is generally regarded as a tumor suppressor. However, the effects of PHD2 in tumorigenesis are not entirely dependent on HIF-\u03b1. Based on the data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we found that the expression of PHD2 is upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for approximately 80-85% of lung cancers, suggesting that PHD2 may play an important role in NSCLC. However, the function of PHD2 in NSCLC remains largely unknown. In this study, we established PHD2-deficient H1299 cells to investigate the function of PHD2 in NSCLC, and found that PHD2 suppressed cell proliferation and metabolism, but induced ROS levels in human NSCLC cells. Further results indicated that the function of PHD2 in NSCLC is dependent on its enzymatic activity and partially independent of HIF. Moreover, we performed RNA-seq and transcriptomics analysis to explore the underlying mechanisms, and identified some potential targets and pathways regulated by PHD2, apart from the canonical HIF-mediated hypoxia signaling pathway. These results provide some clues to uncover novel roles of PHD2 in lung cancer progression."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1.

            "Squamous cell lung cancer (LUSC) is a frequently diagnosed histological subtype of lung malignancy associated with high mortality due to limited number of treatment options. Identification of potential targets suitable for drug development using high-throughput methods is still lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to analyze expression profiles of mRNA and miRNA in LUSC, aiming to identify the key molecules associated with tumorigenesis and prognosis (overall survival; OS). We performed differential gene expression analysis, pathway enrichment analysis and gene ontology analysis on RNA-seq data obtained from 23 FFPE tumor samples and 3 FFPE healthy individuals. TCGA LUSC and GTEx healthy donors\u2019 cohorts were used for validation. We identified 1133 up-regulated and 644 down-regulated genes, common for both cohorts. The most significant up-regulated genes were involved in cell-cycle regulation pathways, while down-regulated genes predominately belonged to immune-related pathways. Survival analysis performed on selected genes, commonly dysregulated in both cohorts and performed only on non-metastatic patients, identified novel prognostic biomarkers associated with OS in early-stage LUSC patients (HOXC4-worse OS, p=0.0001; LILRA5-better OS, p=0.0086). In total, 50 differentially expressed genes are correlated with patients\u2019 OS. Aiming to get better insight into the profile of the tumor microenvironment, we estimated levels of immune-cells infiltration in LUSC and identified 4 subtypes based on immune-cell infiltration levels. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built based on differentially expressed genes, and PPI modules and hub-genes were identified. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was conducted to identify significant modules and hub-genes in correlation to clinical traits. Differential analysis on miRNA-Seq data, obtained from 16 tumor and 4 healthy tissue samples, was conducted as well. 75 up-regulated and 47 down-regulated miRNAs were identified. Further, targets of differentially expressed miRNA were identified, following gene ontology analysis and miRNA-mRNA networks construction."

            "To better elucidate the complex interaction between COPD and NSCLC, we comprehensively characterized immune cell dynamics and transcriptome profiles of malignant cells in tumor tissues from NSCLC patients with COPD using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We observed increased fractions of exhausted CD8+ T cells, CCL18+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and LAMP3+ dendritic cells (DCs) in the immune component of NSCLC with COPD compared with the findings in NSCLC without COPD. Remarkably, a critical cluster of malignant cells from NSCLC with COPD samples, characterized by high expression of CD74, significantly exhibited an epithelial-immune dual signature and was associated with poor prognosis. Interestingly, we found that CD74 facilitated phosphorylation of MAPK/STAT3 to mediate PD-L1 expression and further suppressed CD8+ T cell function, triggering LC progression. Our study provides a comprehensive profiling of the multi-cellular ecosystem of NSCLC with coexisting COPD and reveals that CD74+ cancer cells are potential targets for immunotherapy."

We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TCs) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer.

            "Objectives: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and challenging diagnosis. Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.  Conclusion: This study proposes a miRNA-based biomarker classifier for SCLC that considers clinical demographics with specific cut offs to inform SCLC diagnosis."

            "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples. And the three miRNAs selected by DFL potentially represent an effective molecular signature for LUAD diagnosis."

Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer.

For early-stage lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate for patients ranges from 80% in stage IA to 41% in stage IIIA, and many cases relapse after surgical resection. Currently, multiple clinical trials have manifested the encouraging efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC.

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "High dose intravenous vitamin C (IVC) has been proposed as a pro-oxidant anticancer agent. However, there lack biomarkers that are specific for this treatment. Here we explored profiles of gene expression responding to IVC treatment in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells as an effort for potential biomarker discovery. Genome-wide RNA-seq was performed in human NSCLC cell lines treated with pharmacological concentrations of vitamin C\uff08VitC\uff09 for differential expression of genes. The identified genes were analyzed for correlations with patient prognosis using data from the Kaplan-Meier Plotter and the Human Protein Atlas databases. Further, tumor samples from a retrospective study of 153 NSCLC patients were analyzed with immunohistochemistry for expression of targeted genes, and patient prognosis was correlated to these genes. Two genes, namely SERPINE1 and SERPINB7 were found to be downregulated in NSCLC cells following VitC treatment. Combined patient data from the cohort analysis and online databases revealed that these 2 genes presented an unfavorable prognostic prediction of overall survival (OS) in NSCLC patients receiving standard of care. However, high expression level of these 2 genes were associated with prolonged OS in NSCLC patients receiving IVC in addition to standard of care. These data revealed that SERPINE1 and SERPINB7 have the potential to serve as predictive factors indicating favorable responses to IVC treatment in patients with NSCLC. Further validations are warranted."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

        "summary": [
            "Objectives: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and challenging diagnosis. Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.  Conclusion: This study proposes a miRNA-based biomarker classifier for SCLC that considers clinical demographics with specific cut offs to inform SCLC diagnosis."

            "To better elucidate the complex interaction between COPD and NSCLC, we comprehensively characterized immune cell dynamics and transcriptome profiles of malignant cells in tumor tissues from NSCLC patients with COPD using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We observed increased fractions of exhausted CD8+ T cells, CCL18+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and LAMP3+ dendritic cells (DCs) in the immune component of NSCLC with COPD compared with the findings in NSCLC without COPD. Remarkably, a critical cluster of malignant cells from NSCLC with COPD samples, characterized by high expression of CD74, significantly exhibited an epithelial-immune dual signature and was associated with poor prognosis. Interestingly, we found that CD74 facilitated phosphorylation of MAPK/STAT3 to mediate PD-L1 expression and further suppressed CD8+ T cell function, triggering LC progression. Our study provides a comprehensive profiling of the multi-cellular ecosystem of NSCLC with coexisting COPD and reveals that CD74+ cancer cells are potential targets for immunotherapy."

Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils.

            "The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TCs) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity\u2014as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics.

We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer. Our study suggests that cfDNA 5hmC analysis is a minimally invasive, innovative strategy for guiding treatment selection in lung cancer patients."

            "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples. And the three miRNAs selected by DFL potentially represent an effective molecular signature for LUAD diagnosis."

ERR\u03b3 functions as an essential activator of ECM remodeling and cell adhesion, two critical steps in metastasis, by directly regulating the expression of major genes involved in these processes. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of ERR\u03b3 markedly reduces collagen production, cell-matrix adhesion, microfilaments production, and eventually blocks SCLC cell invasion and tumor metastasis. Notably, ERR\u03b3 antagonists significantly suppress tumor growth and metastasis and restore resistant SCLC vulnerability to chemotherapy in multiple cell-derived and patient-derived xenograft models. Taken together, these findings establish ERR\u03b3 as an attractive target for metastatic SCLC and provide a potential pharmacological strategy for treating this lethal disease."

We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer. Our study suggests that cfDNA 5hmC analysis is a minimally invasive, innovative strategy for guiding treatment selection in lung cancer patients."

We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils.

            "The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TCs) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

            "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples. And the three miRNAs selected by DFL potentially represent an effective molecular signature for LUAD diagnosis."

However, the genetic mechanisms and target genes underlying these loci are largely unknown, as most risk-associated-variants might regulate gene expression in a context-specific manner. Here, we generated a barcode-shared multiome (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map) of 117,911 human lung cells from ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes. Our multiome dataset identified lung cancer susceptibility genes that were not detected in previous tissue- or cell-line-based approaches and further revealed the cell types and contexts where the susceptibility genes are functional, including the interplay of epithelial and immune cell types even in a single locus."

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TCs) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

Here, we generated a barcode-shared multiome (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map) of 117,911 human lung cells from ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes. Our multiome dataset identified lung cancer susceptibility genes that were not detected in previous tissue- or cell-line-based approaches and further revealed the cell types and contexts where the susceptibility genes are functional, including the interplay of epithelial and immune cell types even in a single locus."

High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils.

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TCs) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity\u2014as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics.

We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "We identified a critical oncogenic role for Protocadherin 7 (PCDH7), a cell surface protein and member of the Cadherin superfamily in NSCLC. PCDH7 is frequently overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and associates with poor clinical outcome. Depletion of Pcdh7 reduces lung tumor burden and prolongs survival in mouse models of high-grade NSCLC, demonstrating that this protein is an actionable therapeutic target. Here we report the development and characterization of high affinity anti-PCDH7 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that inhibit downstream MAPK pathway activation and suppress tumor growth in multiple mouse models, including KRAS- and EGFR-mutant models. A lead mAb (mAb7) sensitized tumors to the FDA-approved MEK inhibitor trametinib. Moreover, the humanized mAb7-IgG1 exhibited antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and Fc-mediated immune effector killing of tumor cells in vivo.  These findings provide an important step towards the clinical development of PCDH7-targeting antibodies for the treatment of NSCLC and other tumor types with high PCDH7 expression."

Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample.

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, of which approximately 85% are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced NSCLC was significantly prolonged with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis. For early-stage lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate for patients ranges from 80% in stage IA to 41% in stage IIIA, and many cases relapse after surgical resection. Currently, multiple clinical trials have manifested the encouraging efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC. However, the effect of immunotherapy in ultra early-stage NSCLC patients with micro-invasive or even pre-invasive lesions remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the activity and safety of sintilimab on high-risk ground glass opacity lesions in multiple primary lung cancer patients."

            "Objectives: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and challenging diagnosis. Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.

            "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples. And the three miRNAs selected by DFL potentially represent an effective molecular signature for LUAD diagnosis."

ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity\u2014as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics.

Here, we demonstrate that genetic inhibition of S100A9, ALDH1A1, RAR, or pharmacological inhibition of the RA pathway using pan-RAR inhibitors significantly reduces brain relapse from osimertinib-refractory cancer cells. Our study has therefore revealed a novel S100A9-ALDH1A1-RA signaling axis in the EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells that drives osimertinib-refractory metastatic brain relapse and identified a potential vulnerability in lung cancer cells that can be therapeutically targeted to prolong progression-free survival in EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients."

Histological and transcriptomic analyses confirmed that the main features from the original tumor were reproduced. The 3D tumor model could be used to determine the dynamics of response to antiangiogenic therapy and platinum-based chemotherapy. Antiangiogenic therapy showed a significant decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A expression, reflecting its therapeutic effect in the model. In an immune-infiltrated PDT model, chemotherapy showed the ability to decrease the levels of lymphocyte activation gene-3 protein (LAG-3), B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) and inhibitory receptors of T cells functions."

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TCs) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified over fifty genomic loci associated with lung cancer risk. However, the genetic mechanisms and target genes underlying these loci are largely unknown, as most risk-associated-variants might regulate gene expression in a context-specific manner. Here, we generated a barcode-shared multiome (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map) of 117,911 human lung cells from ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes. Our multiome dataset identified lung cancer susceptibility genes that were not detected in previous tissue- or cell-line-based approaches and further revealed the cell types and contexts where the susceptibility genes are functional, including the interplay of epithelial and immune cell types even in a single locus."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TCs) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer. Our study suggests that cfDNA 5hmC analysis is a minimally invasive, innovative strategy for guiding treatment selection in lung cancer patients."

ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity\u2014as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics.

We observed increased fractions of exhausted CD8+ T cells, CCL18+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and LAMP3+ dendritic cells (DCs) in the immune component of NSCLC with COPD compared with the findings in NSCLC without COPD. Remarkably, a critical cluster of malignant cells from NSCLC with COPD samples, characterized by high expression of CD74, significantly exhibited an epithelial-immune dual signature and was associated with poor prognosis. Interestingly, we found that CD74 facilitated phosphorylation of MAPK/STAT3 to mediate PD-L1 expression and further suppressed CD8+ T cell function, triggering LC progression.

ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity\u2014as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics.

            "Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) can be classified into transcriptional subtypes with distinct degrees of neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation. Recent evidence supports plasticity among subtypes with a bias toward adoption of low-NE states during disease progression or upon acquired chemotherapy resistance. Here, we identify a role for SMARCA4, the catalytic subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, as a regulator of subtype shift in SCLC. SMARCA4 binds to gene loci encoding NE-lineage transcription factors ASCL1 and NEUROD1 and alters chromatin accessibility, suppressing NE programs. In parallel, SMARCA4 also controls REST, a known suppressor of the NE phenotype, by regulating SRRM4-dependent REST splicing. The SMARCA2/4 inhibitor FHD-286 induces loss of NE features and drives ERBB pathway activation in SCLC, rendering SCLC tumors sensitive to afatinib. This study nominates SMARCA4 as a key regulator of the NE state plasticity and defines a novel therapeutic strategy for SCLC."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TCs) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "We identified a critical oncogenic role for Protocadherin 7 (PCDH7), a cell surface protein and member of the Cadherin superfamily in NSCLC. PCDH7 is frequently overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and associates with poor clinical outcome. Depletion of Pcdh7 reduces lung tumor burden and prolongs survival in mouse models of high-grade NSCLC, demonstrating that this protein is an actionable therapeutic target. Here we report the development and characterization of high affinity anti-PCDH7 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that inhibit downstream MAPK pathway activation and suppress tumor growth in multiple mouse models, including KRAS- and EGFR-mutant models. A lead mAb (mAb7) sensitized tumors to the FDA-approved MEK inhibitor trametinib. Moreover, the humanized mAb7-IgG1 exhibited antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and Fc-mediated immune effector killing of tumor cells in vivo.  These findings provide an important step towards the clinical development of PCDH7-targeting antibodies for the treatment of NSCLC and other tumor types with high PCDH7 expression."

            "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples. And the three miRNAs selected by DFL potentially represent an effective molecular signature for LUAD diagnosis."

Therefore, the purpose of this research is to analyze expression profiles of mRNA and miRNA in LUSC, aiming to identify the key molecules associated with tumorigenesis and prognosis (overall survival; OS). We performed differential gene expression analysis, pathway enrichment analysis and gene ontology analysis on RNA-seq data obtained from 23 FFPE tumor samples and 3 FFPE healthy individuals. TCGA LUSC and GTEx healthy donors\u2019 cohorts were used for validation. We identified 1133 up-regulated and 644 down-regulated genes, common for both cohorts. The most significant up-regulated genes were involved in cell-cycle regulation pathways, while down-regulated genes predominately belonged to immune-related pathways. Survival analysis performed on selected genes, commonly dysregulated in both cohorts and performed only on non-metastatic patients, identified novel prognostic biomarkers associated with OS in early-stage LUSC patients (HOXC4-worse OS, p=0.0001; LILRA5-better OS, p=0.0086). In total, 50 differentially expressed genes are correlated with patients\u2019 OS. Aiming to get better insight into the profile of the tumor microenvironment, we estimated levels of immune-cells infiltration in LUSC and identified 4 subtypes based on immune-cell infiltration levels. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built based on differentially expressed genes, and PPI modules and hub-genes were identified. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was conducted to identify significant modules and hub-genes in correlation to clinical traits. Differential analysis on miRNA-Seq data, obtained from 16 tumor and 4 healthy tissue samples, was conducted as well. 75 up-regulated and 47 down-regulated miRNAs were identified. Further, targets of differentially expressed miRNA were identified, following gene ontology analysis and miRNA-mRNA networks construction."

        ],
        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

We observed increased fractions of exhausted CD8+ T cells, CCL18+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and LAMP3+ dendritic cells (DCs) in the immune component of NSCLC with COPD compared with the findings in NSCLC without COPD. Remarkably, a critical cluster of malignant cells from NSCLC with COPD samples, characterized by high expression of CD74, significantly exhibited an epithelial-immune dual signature and was associated with poor prognosis. Interestingly, we found that CD74 facilitated phosphorylation of MAPK/STAT3 to mediate PD-L1 expression and further suppressed CD8+ T cell function, triggering LC progression. Our study provides a comprehensive profiling of the multi-cellular ecosystem of NSCLC with coexisting COPD and reveals that CD74+ cancer cells are potential targets for immunotherapy."

            "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples. And the three miRNAs selected by DFL potentially represent an effective molecular signature for LUAD diagnosis."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

Bispecific antibodies have been developed to direct cytotoxic T lymphocytes to the tumor site and foster their activities to reduce tumor immune resistance. Although applied with success, bispecific antibodies are not universally effective partially due to the expression of pro-survival factors by tumor cells. Here, we report a CRISPR/Cas9 screen in human non-small cell lung cancer for genes that confer tumors with increased resistance to T lymphocyte mediated killing. We show that lung carcinoma cells devoid of expression of the gene C22orf46 exhibit increased susceptibility to T cell induced apoptosis and genotoxic stress mediated by chemotherapeutic agents. We present data showing that C22orf46, previously annotated as a non-coding gene, encodes an expressed nucleolar protein with remote homologies to the BH domain-containing Bcl-2 family and propose to name this protein Tumor Apoptosis Associated Protein 1 (TAAP1).

The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "Background: Accumulating evidence indicates that aberrant non-SMC condensin II complex subunit D3 (NCAPD3) is associated with carcinogenesis of various cancers. Nevertheless, the biological role of NCAPD3 in the pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear.Methods: Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were performed to assess NCAPD3 expression in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. The ability of cell proliferation, invasion, and migration was evaluated by CCK-8 assays, EdU assays, Transwell assays, and scratch wound healing assays. Flow cytometry was performed to verify the cell cycle and apoptosis. RNA-sequence and rescue experiment were performed to reveal the underlying mechanisms.Results: The results showed that the expression of NCAPD3 was significantly elevated in NSCLC tissues. In NSCLC patients, high NCAPD3 expression was substantially associated with a worse prognosis. Functionally, knockdown of NCAPD3 resulted in cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in NSCLC cells as well as a significant inhibition of proliferation, invasion, and migration. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing analysis suggested that NCAPD3 contributes to NSCLC cancer carcinogenesis by regulating PI3K/Akt/FOXO4 pathway. Insulin-like growth factors-1 (IGF-1), a PI3K/Akt signaling activator, could reverse NCAPD3 silence-mediated proliferation inhibition and apoptosis in NSCLC cells.Conclusion: NCAPD3 suppresses apoptosis and promotes cell proliferation via the PI3K/Akt/FOXO4 signaling pathway, suggesting a potential use for NCAPD3 inhibitors as NSCLC therapeutics."

            "Objectives: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and challenging diagnosis. Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.  Conclusion: This study proposes a miRNA-based biomarker classifier for SCLC that considers clinical demographics with specific cut offs to inform SCLC diagnosis."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

Our study has therefore revealed a novel S100A9-ALDH1A1-RA signaling axis in the EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells that drives osimertinib-refractory metastatic brain relapse and identified a potential vulnerability in lung cancer cells that can be therapeutically targeted to prolong progression-free survival in EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients."

            "The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TCs) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

For early-stage lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate for patients ranges from 80% in stage IA to 41% in stage IIIA, and many cases relapse after surgical resection. Currently, multiple clinical trials have manifested the encouraging efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC. However, the effect of immunotherapy in ultra early-stage NSCLC patients with micro-invasive or even pre-invasive lesions remains unclear.

We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TCs) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "To better elucidate the complex interaction between COPD and NSCLC, we comprehensively characterized immune cell dynamics and transcriptome profiles of malignant cells in tumor tissues from NSCLC patients with COPD using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We observed increased fractions of exhausted CD8+ T cells, CCL18+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and LAMP3+ dendritic cells (DCs) in the immune component of NSCLC with COPD compared with the findings in NSCLC without COPD. Remarkably, a critical cluster of malignant cells from NSCLC with COPD samples, characterized by high expression of CD74, significantly exhibited an epithelial-immune dual signature and was associated with poor prognosis. Interestingly, we found that CD74 facilitated phosphorylation of MAPK/STAT3 to mediate PD-L1 expression and further suppressed CD8+ T cell function, triggering LC progression. Our study provides a comprehensive profiling of the multi-cellular ecosystem of NSCLC with coexisting COPD and reveals that CD74+ cancer cells are potential targets for immunotherapy."

Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration.

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

        "summary": [
            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "High dose intravenous vitamin C (IVC) has been proposed as a pro-oxidant anticancer agent. However, there lack biomarkers that are specific for this treatment. Here we explored profiles of gene expression responding to IVC treatment in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells as an effort for potential biomarker discovery. Genome-wide RNA-seq was performed in human NSCLC cell lines treated with pharmacological concentrations of vitamin C\uff08VitC\uff09 for differential expression of genes. The identified genes were analyzed for correlations with patient prognosis using data from the Kaplan-Meier Plotter and the Human Protein Atlas databases. Further, tumor samples from a retrospective study of 153 NSCLC patients were analyzed with immunohistochemistry for expression of targeted genes, and patient prognosis was correlated to these genes. Two genes, namely SERPINE1 and SERPINB7 were found to be downregulated in NSCLC cells following VitC treatment. Combined patient data from the cohort analysis and online databases revealed that these 2 genes presented an unfavorable prognostic prediction of overall survival (OS) in NSCLC patients receiving standard of care. However, high expression level of these 2 genes were associated with prolonged OS in NSCLC patients receiving IVC in addition to standard of care. These data revealed that SERPINE1 and SERPINB7 have the potential to serve as predictive factors indicating favorable responses to IVC treatment in patients with NSCLC. Further validations are warranted."

            "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified over fifty genomic loci associated with lung cancer risk. However, the genetic mechanisms and target genes underlying these loci are largely unknown, as most risk-associated-variants might regulate gene expression in a context-specific manner. Here, we generated a barcode-shared multiome (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map) of 117,911 human lung cells from ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes. Our multiome dataset identified lung cancer susceptibility genes that were not detected in previous tissue- or cell-line-based approaches and further revealed the cell types and contexts where the susceptibility genes are functional, including the interplay of epithelial and immune cell types even in a single locus."

            "Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, of which approximately 85% are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced NSCLC was significantly prolonged with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis. For early-stage lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate for patients ranges from 80% in stage IA to 41% in stage IIIA, and many cases relapse after surgical resection. Currently, multiple clinical trials have manifested the encouraging efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC. However, the effect of immunotherapy in ultra early-stage NSCLC patients with micro-invasive or even pre-invasive lesions remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the activity and safety of sintilimab on high-risk ground glass opacity lesions in multiple primary lung cancer patients."

Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

Depletion of Pcdh7 reduces lung tumor burden and prolongs survival in mouse models of high-grade NSCLC, demonstrating that this protein is an actionable therapeutic target. Here we report the development and characterization of high affinity anti-PCDH7 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that inhibit downstream MAPK pathway activation and suppress tumor growth in multiple mouse models, including KRAS- and EGFR-mutant models. A lead mAb (mAb7) sensitized tumors to the FDA-approved MEK inhibitor trametinib. Moreover, the humanized mAb7-IgG1 exhibited antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and Fc-mediated immune effector killing of tumor cells in vivo.

            "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) drastically improve therapeutic outcomes for lung cancer, but accurate prediction of individual patient responses to ICIs remains a challenge. We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer. Our study suggests that cfDNA 5hmC analysis is a minimally invasive, innovative strategy for guiding treatment selection in lung cancer patients."

            "Squamous cell lung cancer (LUSC) is a frequently diagnosed histological subtype of lung malignancy associated with high mortality due to limited number of treatment options. Identification of potential targets suitable for drug development using high-throughput methods is still lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to analyze expression profiles of mRNA and miRNA in LUSC, aiming to identify the key molecules associated with tumorigenesis and prognosis (overall survival; OS). We performed differential gene expression analysis, pathway enrichment analysis and gene ontology analysis on RNA-seq data obtained from 23 FFPE tumor samples and 3 FFPE healthy individuals. TCGA LUSC and GTEx healthy donors\u2019 cohorts were used for validation. We identified 1133 up-regulated and 644 down-regulated genes, common for both cohorts. The most significant up-regulated genes were involved in cell-cycle regulation pathways, while down-regulated genes predominately belonged to immune-related pathways. Survival analysis performed on selected genes, commonly dysregulated in both cohorts and performed only on non-metastatic patients, identified novel prognostic biomarkers associated with OS in early-stage LUSC patients (HOXC4-worse OS, p=0.0001; LILRA5-better OS, p=0.0086). In total, 50 differentially expressed genes are correlated with patients\u2019 OS. Aiming to get better insight into the profile of the tumor microenvironment, we estimated levels of immune-cells infiltration in LUSC and identified 4 subtypes based on immune-cell infiltration levels. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built based on differentially expressed genes, and PPI modules and hub-genes were identified. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was conducted to identify significant modules and hub-genes in correlation to clinical traits. Differential analysis on miRNA-Seq data, obtained from 16 tumor and 4 healthy tissue samples, was conducted as well. 75 up-regulated and 47 down-regulated miRNAs were identified. Further, targets of differentially expressed miRNA were identified, following gene ontology analysis and miRNA-mRNA networks construction."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples. And the three miRNAs selected by DFL potentially represent an effective molecular signature for LUAD diagnosis."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

Depletion of Pcdh7 reduces lung tumor burden and prolongs survival in mouse models of high-grade NSCLC, demonstrating that this protein is an actionable therapeutic target. Here we report the development and characterization of high affinity anti-PCDH7 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that inhibit downstream MAPK pathway activation and suppress tumor growth in multiple mouse models, including KRAS- and EGFR-mutant models. A lead mAb (mAb7) sensitized tumors to the FDA-approved MEK inhibitor trametinib. Moreover, the humanized mAb7-IgG1 exhibited antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and Fc-mediated immune effector killing of tumor cells in vivo.

            "Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, of which approximately 85% are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced NSCLC was significantly prolonged with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis. For early-stage lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate for patients ranges from 80% in stage IA to 41% in stage IIIA, and many cases relapse after surgical resection. Currently, multiple clinical trials have manifested the encouraging efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC. However, the effect of immunotherapy in ultra early-stage NSCLC patients with micro-invasive or even pre-invasive lesions remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the activity and safety of sintilimab on high-risk ground glass opacity lesions in multiple primary lung cancer patients."

            "The olfactory epithelium relies on active neuron regeneration from basal stem cells and is susceptible to olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB), a rare, aggressive tumor of unclear origins. Here, we establish a new, highly-penetrant, genetically-engineered mouse model of ONB with alterations in Rb1/Trp53/Myc that exhibit a NEUROD1+ immature neuronal state. ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity\u2014as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics. Collectively, our findings highlight conserved developmental trajectories between ONB and SCLC subtypes with significant implications for ONB classification and treatment."

However, the genetic mechanisms and target genes underlying these loci are largely unknown, as most risk-associated-variants might regulate gene expression in a context-specific manner. Here, we generated a barcode-shared multiome (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map) of 117,911 human lung cells from ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes. Our multiome dataset identified lung cancer susceptibility genes that were not detected in previous tissue- or cell-line-based approaches and further revealed the cell types and contexts where the susceptibility genes are functional, including the interplay of epithelial and immune cell types even in a single locus."

Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified over fifty genomic loci associated with lung cancer risk. However, the genetic mechanisms and target genes underlying these loci are largely unknown, as most risk-associated-variants might regulate gene expression in a context-specific manner. Here, we generated a barcode-shared multiome (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map) of 117,911 human lung cells from ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes. Our multiome dataset identified lung cancer susceptibility genes that were not detected in previous tissue- or cell-line-based approaches and further revealed the cell types and contexts where the susceptibility genes are functional, including the interplay of epithelial and immune cell types even in a single locus."

            "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) drastically improve therapeutic outcomes for lung cancer, but accurate prediction of individual patient responses to ICIs remains a challenge. We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer. Our study suggests that cfDNA 5hmC analysis is a minimally invasive, innovative strategy for guiding treatment selection in lung cancer patients."

            "The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TCs) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

            "Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive and lethal type of lung cancer, characterized by limited treatment options, early and frequent metastasis. However, the determinants of metastasis in SCLC are poorly defined. Here, we show that estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERR\u03b3) is overexpressed in metastatic SCLC tumors, and it is positively associated with SCLC progression. ERR\u03b3 functions as an essential activator of ECM remodeling and cell adhesion, two critical steps in metastasis, by directly regulating the expression of major genes involved in these processes. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of ERR\u03b3 markedly reduces collagen production, cell-matrix adhesion, microfilaments production, and eventually blocks SCLC cell invasion and tumor metastasis. Notably, ERR\u03b3 antagonists significantly suppress tumor growth and metastasis and restore resistant SCLC vulnerability to chemotherapy in multiple cell-derived and patient-derived xenograft models. Taken together, these findings establish ERR\u03b3 as an attractive target for metastatic SCLC and provide a potential pharmacological strategy for treating this lethal disease."

Here, we establish a new, highly-penetrant, genetically-engineered mouse model of ONB with alterations in Rb1/Trp53/Myc that exhibit a NEUROD1+ immature neuronal state. ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity\u2014as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics.

            "Background: MET inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring METex14 skipping alterations. Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."

We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer. Our study suggests that cfDNA 5hmC analysis is a minimally invasive, innovative strategy for guiding treatment selection in lung cancer patients."

ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity\u2014as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics.

            "Objectives: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and challenging diagnosis. Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.  Conclusion: This study proposes a miRNA-based biomarker classifier for SCLC that considers clinical demographics with specific cut offs to inform SCLC diagnosis."

However, the kinetics and sequence of molecular events governing this adaptive response remain poorly understood. Here, we performed transcriptomic profiling by RNAseq in a panel of EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines (PC9, HCC4006, H3255 and HCC827) that were previously subcloned to minimize the presence of potential pre-existing resistant cells. Cells were treated by either erlotinib (1 \u00b5M) or osimertinib (1 \u00b5M) for a short period (24h), until drug-tolerance (between 7 and 21 days), and until development of fully resistant proliferative cells (RPC)."

            "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples. And the three miRNAs selected by DFL potentially represent an effective molecular signature for LUAD diagnosis."

ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity\u2014as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics.

Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the tumor microenvironment that are related to tumoral PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration."

            "Lung cancer (LC) mortality rates are still increasing globally. As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."

            "Objectives: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and challenging diagnosis. Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.  Conclusion: This study proposes a miRNA-based biomarker classifier for SCLC that considers clinical demographics with specific cut offs to inform SCLC diagnosis."

Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

            "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples.

            "Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, of which approximately 85% are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced NSCLC was significantly prolonged with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis. For early-stage lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate for patients ranges from 80% in stage IA to 41% in stage IIIA, and many cases relapse after surgical resection. Currently, multiple clinical trials have manifested the encouraging efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in stage I-IIIA resectable NSCLC. However, the effect of immunotherapy in ultra early-stage NSCLC patients with micro-invasive or even pre-invasive lesions remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the activity and safety of sintilimab on high-risk ground glass opacity lesions in multiple primary lung cancer patients."

            "Objectives: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and challenging diagnosis. Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.  Conclusion: This study proposes a miRNA-based biomarker classifier for SCLC that considers clinical demographics with specific cut offs to inform SCLC diagnosis."

We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer.

Our study has therefore revealed a novel S100A9-ALDH1A1-RA signaling axis in the EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells that drives osimertinib-refractory metastatic brain relapse and identified a potential vulnerability in lung cancer cells that can be therapeutically targeted to prolong progression-free survival in EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients."

            "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) drastically improve therapeutic outcomes for lung cancer, but accurate prediction of individual patient responses to ICIs remains a challenge. We performed a genome-wide analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 83 lung cancer patients. Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer. Our study suggests that cfDNA 5hmC analysis is a minimally invasive, innovative strategy for guiding treatment selection in lung cancer patients."

However, the kinetics and sequence of molecular events governing this adaptive response remain poorly understood. Here, we performed transcriptomic profiling by RNAseq in a panel of EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines (PC9, HCC4006, H3255 and HCC827) that were previously subcloned to minimize the presence of potential pre-existing resistant cells. Cells were treated by either erlotinib (1 \u00b5M) or osimertinib (1 \u00b5M) for a short period (24h), until drug-tolerance (between 7 and 21 days), and until development of fully resistant proliferative cells (RPC)."
