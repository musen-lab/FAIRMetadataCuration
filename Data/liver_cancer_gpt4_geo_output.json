Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response.

Liver cancer is notoriously refractory to conventional therapeutics. Further insight into the etiology carries promise for innovative diagnostics and therapeutics. Tumor progression is governed by interplay between tumor promoting genes and suppressor genes. BRD4, an acetyl-lysine binding protein, plays a critical role in development and human diseases. In many cancer types, BRD4 is overexpressed and promotes activation of a pro-tumor gene network. But the underlying mechanism for BRD4 overexpression remains elusive. As BRD4 has risen as a promising therapeutic target, to understand the mechanism regulating BRD4 protein level will shed insight into BRD4-targeting therapeutics. In this study, we find BRD4 protein level in liver cancer is significantly regulated by P53, the most frequently dysregulated tumor suppressor. We identify a strong negative correlation between protein levels of P53 and BRD4 in liver cancer. We then show P53 promotes BRD4 protein degradation. Mechanistically, P53 represses the transcription of USP1, a deubiquitinase, through P21-RB. We show USP1 is a deubiquitinase of BRD4, which increases its stability. We show the pro-tumor role of USP1 is partially mediated by BRD4 and the USP1-BRD4 axis upholds expression of a group of cancer-related genes.

Liver cancer is notoriously refractory to conventional therapeutics. Further insight into the etiology carries promise for innovative diagnostics and therapeutics. Tumor progression is governed by interplay between tumor promoting genes and suppressor genes. BRD4, an acetyl-lysine binding protein, plays a critical role in development and human diseases. In many cancer types, BRD4 is overexpressed and promotes activation of a pro-tumor gene network. But the underlying mechanism for BRD4 overexpression remains elusive. As BRD4 has risen as a promising therapeutic target, to understand the mechanism regulating BRD4 protein level will shed insight into BRD4-targeting therapeutics. In this study, we find BRD4 protein level in liver cancer is significantly regulated by P53, the most frequently dysregulated tumor suppressor. We identify a strong negative correlation between protein levels of P53 and BRD4 in liver cancer. We then show P53 promotes BRD4 protein degradation. Mechanistically, P53 represses the transcription of USP1, a deubiquitinase, through P21-RB. We show USP1 is a deubiquitinase of BRD4, which increases its stability. We show the pro-tumor role of USP1 is partially mediated by BRD4 and the USP1-BRD4 axis upholds expression of a group of cancer-related genes. In summary, we identify a functional P53-P21-RB-USP1-BRD4 axis in liver cancer.", "organism": "Homo sapiens", "age": "NA", "biomaterial_provider": "NA", "sex": "NA", "tissue": "Liver", "cell_type": "Hepatocellular Carcinoma", "cell_line": "HepG2", "design": "NA", "disease": "Liver Cancer", "treatment": "NA", "description": "Study of the impact of P53-P21-RB pathway on BRD4 degradation in liver cancer"}}

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Compound 6j could induce liver cancer cells ferroptosis by promoting the accumulation of intracellular Fe2+, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and MDA. Inhibition of ferroptosis by ferrostatin-1 alleviated 6j induced accumulation of Fe2+, ROS, and MDA and restored cell viability. Further study revealed that compound 6j upregulated the expression of ATF3 via ER stress and knockdown of ATF3 by RNA interference attenuated 6j induced ferroptosis and cell proliferation inhibition. This study would provide new insights for the design of ferroptosis inducers and the development of anti-liver cancer drugs.", "organism": "NA", "age": "NA", "biomaterial_provider": "NA", "sex": "NA", "tissue": "liver", "cell_type": "liver cancer cell", "cell_line": "MHCC-97H", "design": "NA", "disease": "liver cancer", "treatment": "compound 6j", "description": "NA"}}

We observed G2/M cell cycle phase arrest in HCC cells upon combination treatment compared to the single-treated or vehicle-treated control cells. The downregulation of CCNA2 and CDC25C following combination therapy further supported the observation. Subsequent analyses demonstrated that combination treatment inhibited 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) phosphorylation, and increased Bim expression. Apoptosis of HCC cells were accompanied by increased poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and caspase-9 activation. Next, we observed that a combination therapy significantly delayed the progression of HCC xenograft growth as compared to vehicle control. Together, our results suggested combining cabozantinib and silmitasertib would be a promising treatment option for HCC.", "organism": "NA", "age": "NA", "biomaterial_provider": "NA", "sex": "NA", "tissue": "liver", "cell_type": "NA", "cell_line": "THH", "design": "NA", "disease": "hepatocellular carcinoma", "treatment": "vehicle", "description": "NA"}}

Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset. Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients. Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.

Importantly, single-gene survival analysis of CTSV using microarray and sequencing data indicated that high levels of CTSV expression correlated with an unfavorable prognosis in various cancers. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that high CTSV expression closely correlated with decreased expression of metabolic genes and increased expression of cell cycle genes. Furthermore, difference and correlation analyses of the relationship between CTSV expression and immune infiltrates, determined using CIBERSORT and TIMER algorithms, revealed that CTSV expression correlated with macrophages and CD4+ T cells. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that knockdown of CTSV inhibited liver cancer cells proliferation. Immunohistochemical staining showed that high CTSV expression correlated with macrophage infiltration in liver cancer tissues, predicted a poor prognosis, and may serve as a biomarker for HCC therapy.In conclusion, CTSV is a novel cell cycle prognostic gene that can affect HCC cells proliferation, and a potential biomarker for HCC therapy.", "organism": "NA", "age": "NA", "biomaterial_provider": "NA", "sex": "NA", "tissue": "liver", "cell_type": "tumor cells", "cell_line": "Huh7", "design": "NA", "disease": "hepatocellular carcinoma", "treatment": "CTSV knockdown", "description": "NA"}}

Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset. Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients. Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group. Conclusion: This study proposes a miRNA-based biomarker classifier for SCLC that considers clinical demographics with specific cut offs to inform SCLC diagnosis."}, "LLM+CEDAR": {"geo_accession": "GSE243245", "gsm_accession": ["GSM7781779"], "title": "Crosstalk between myeloid and B cells shapes the distinct microenvironments of primary and secondary liver cancer", "summary": "The tumor microenvironment is distinctive in primary and secondary liver cancer.

In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples.

ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression.

However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset. Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients. Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."}, "LLM+CEDAR": {"geo_accession": "GSE235968", "gsm_accession": "GSM7512493", "title": "A non-canonical repressor function of JUN restrains YAP activity and suppresses YAP-dependent liver cancer growth", "summary": "This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.", "organism": "NA", "age": "NA", "biomaterial_provider": "abcam, ab52771", "sex": "NA", "tissue": "NA", "cell_type": "breast epithelial", "cell_line": "MCF10A", "design": "NA", "disease": "NA", "treatment": "etoh", "description": "NA"}}

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Our recent studies identified HKDC1 as a top candidate associated with liver cancer metastasis. We aimed to compare its cell type specificity with other HKs upregulated in liver cancer and investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying its involvement in liver cancer metastasis. We found that, compared to HK1 and HK2, the other two commonly upregulated HKs in liver cancer, HKDC1 was most strongly associated with the metastasis potential of tumors and organoids derived from two liver cancer mouse models we previously established. RNA in situ hybridization and single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed that HKDC1 was specifically upregulated in malignant cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patient tumors, whereas HK1 and HK2 were widespread across various tumor microenvironment lineages. An unbiased metabolomic profiling demonstrated that HKDC1 overexpression in HCC cells led to metabolic alterations distinct from those from HK1 and HK2 overexpression, with HKDC1 particularly impacting the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

Although targeted therapeutic drugs have achieved certain clinical efficacy, only sorafenib and lenvatinib are currently marketed as first-line targeted drugs to treat patients with advanced liver cancer. Therefore, developing more drugs are urgently needed. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent programmed cell death (PCD) distinct from known PCDs including apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. Targeting ferroptosis is recognized as a promising potential therapeutic modality for liver cancer. Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is an important ferroptosis inducer and targeting ATF3 offers a potential means to cancer therapy.

As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment.

We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils.

AP-1 is a dimeric basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor complex with JUN and FOS proteins being the most abundant members of this family.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples.

Our recent studies identified HKDC1 as a top candidate associated with liver cancer metastasis. We aimed to compare its cell type specificity with other HKs upregulated in liver cancer and investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying its involvement in liver cancer metastasis. We found that, compared to HK1 and HK2, the other two commonly upregulated HKs in liver cancer, HKDC1 was most strongly associated with the metastasis potential of tumors and organoids derived from two liver cancer mouse models we previously established. RNA in situ hybridization and single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed that HKDC1 was specifically upregulated in malignant cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patient tumors, whereas HK1 and HK2 were widespread across various tumor microenvironment lineages. An unbiased metabolomic profiling demonstrated that HKDC1 overexpression in HCC cells led to metabolic alterations distinct from those from HK1 and HK2 overexpression, with HKDC1 particularly impacting the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. HKDC1 was prometastatic in HCC orthotopic and tail vein injection mouse models. Molecularly, HKDC1 was induced by hypoxia and bound to glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 to stabilize \u03b2-catenin, leading to enhanced stemness of HCC cells.

Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset. Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients. Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.

Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively).

However, the function of PHD2 in NSCLC remains largely unknown.

Further results indicated that the function of PHD2 in NSCLC is dependent on its enzymatic activity and partially independent of HIF.

We observed G2/M cell cycle phase arrest in HCC cells upon combination treatment compared to the single-treated or vehicle-treated control cells. The downregulation of CCNA2 and CDC25C following combination therapy further supported the observation. Subsequent analyses demonstrated that combination treatment inhibited 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) phosphorylation, and increased Bim expression. Apoptosis of HCC cells were accompanied by increased poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and caspase-9 activation. Next, we observed that a combination therapy significantly delayed the progression of HCC xenograft growth as compared to vehicle control. Together, our results suggested combining cabozantinib and silmitasertib would be a promising treatment option for HCC.", "organism": "NA", "age": "NA", "biomaterial_provider": "NA", "sex": "NA", "tissue": "liver", "cell_type": "NA", "cell_line": "THH", "design": "NA", "disease": "hepatocellular carcinoma", "treatment": "combination of cabozantinib and silmitasertib", "description": "NA"}}

Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

Our recent studies identified HKDC1 as a top candidate associated with liver cancer metastasis. We aimed to compare its cell type specificity with other HKs upregulated in liver cancer and investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying its involvement in liver cancer metastasis. We found that, compared to HK1 and HK2, the other two commonly upregulated HKs in liver cancer, HKDC1 was most strongly associated with the metastasis potential of tumors and organoids derived from two liver cancer mouse models we previously established. RNA in situ hybridization and single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed that HKDC1 was specifically upregulated in malignant cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patient tumors, whereas HK1 and HK2 were widespread across various tumor microenvironment lineages. An unbiased metabolomic profiling demonstrated that HKDC1 overexpression in HCC cells led to metabolic alterations distinct from those from HK1 and HK2 overexpression, with HKDC1 particularly impacting the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions. These findings highlight the need to further evaluate combinations of MET inhibitors and immunotherapies."}, "LLM+CEDAR": {"geo_accession": "GSE235965", "gsm_accession": ["GSM7512500"], "title": "A non-canonical repressor function of JUN restrains YAP activity and suppresses YAP-dependent liver cancer growth [iYAP5SA_10A_JUN_oe_antibodies_for_JUN_YAP_TEAD]", "summary": "The transcriptional coactivators YAP/TAZ are the critical downstream regulators of the Hippo pathway that regulate gene expression in response to changes in pathway activity, mainly by binding to TEAD transcription factors.

A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1. Moreover, we identified novel 5hmC-associated genes and signaling pathways integral to ICI treatment response in lung cancer.

Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset. Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients. Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.

{"BioSample": {"title": ["RNA helicase DDX5 mediates adaptive response to multi-kinase inhibitors in liver cancer"], "summary": ["Earlier studies linked sorafenib effectiveness to induction of ferroptosis. Herein we demonstrate sorafenib and mTKIs downregulate DDX5 in vitro and in vivo. To understand the effect of DDX5 downregulation, we compared TCGA-derived HCCs expressing low vs. high DDX5 focusing on ferroptosis-related genes. Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key ferroptosis regulator, was significantly overexpressed in DDX5LOW HCCs. Importantly, DDX5-knockdown (DDX5KD) HCC cell lines lacked lipid peroxidation by GPX4 inhibition, indicating DDX5 downregulation suppresses ferroptosis. RNAseq analyses comparing wild type vs. DDX5KD cells in the presence or absence of sorafenib, identified a unique set of genes repressed by DDX5 and upregulated by sorafenib. This set significantly overlaps genes from Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways, including NF-\u03baB inducing Kinase required for non-canonical NF-\u03baB activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of these pathways in combination with sorafenib reduced DDX5KD cell viability.

In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response.

Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression.

Unlike FOS, JUN can also form homodimers, but in the cell, JUN presumably preferentially forms heterodimers with members of the FOS family, which act as potent transcriptional activators. Previous studies identified substantial co-occupancy of YAP/TAZ and AP-1 at genomic sites, and they demonstrated that JUN/FOS heterodimers cooperate with the YAP/TAZ and TEAD transcription factors to drive YAP/TAZ target gene expression. Here, we now elucidate a negative feedback mechanism in which high YAP activity is restrained by the recruitment of homodimeric JUN::JUN/NCOR1 repressor complexes and show that this noncanonical JUN function is part of a tumor suppressor mechanism in the liver.", "organism": "NA", "age": "NA", "biomaterial_provider": "NA", "sex": "NA", "tissue": "liver", "cell_type": "breast epithelial", "cell_line": "MCF10A", "design": "NA", "disease": "liver cancer", "treatment": "YAP5SA expression", "description": "NA"}}

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls).

High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils.

Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.

We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity\u2014as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics.

Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

{"BioSample": {"title": ["RNA helicase DDX5 mediates adaptive response to multi-kinase inhibitors in liver cancer"], "summary": ["Earlier studies linked sorafenib effectiveness to induction of ferroptosis. Herein we demonstrate sorafenib and mTKIs downregulate DDX5 in vitro and in vivo. To understand the effect of DDX5 downregulation, we compared TCGA-derived HCCs expressing low vs. high DDX5 focusing on ferroptosis-related genes. Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key ferroptosis regulator, was significantly overexpressed in DDX5LOW HCCs. Importantly, DDX5-knockdown (DDX5KD) HCC cell lines lacked lipid peroxidation by GPX4 inhibition, indicating DDX5 downregulation suppresses ferroptosis. RNAseq analyses comparing wild type vs. DDX5KD cells in the presence or absence of sorafenib, identified a unique set of genes repressed by DDX5 and upregulated by sorafenib. This set significantly overlaps genes from Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways, including NF-\u03baB inducing Kinase required for non-canonical NF-\u03baB activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of these pathways in combination with sorafenib reduced DDX5KD cell viability.

However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples.

It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples.

As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment.

We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls).

High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively).

Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls).

{"BioSample": {"title": ["LIM homeobox-2 suppresses hallmarks of adult and pediatric liver cancers by controlling MAPK/ERK and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways"], "summary": ["Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Hepatoblastoma (HB) are two liver cancers characterized by high gene deregulation, chromosomal rearrangements and typical mutations in genes related to the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin (Wnt) pathway. LHX2, a transcriptional factor member of the LIM homeobox gene family, has important functions in embryogenesis, liver development but also tumorigenesis. LHX2 is an oncogene in may solid tumors and leukemia but its role in liver cancer is unknown. To address this question we analyzed the expression of LHX2 in HCC and HB using various transcriptomic datasets and found a strong connection between LHX2 down-regulation and Wnt activation in these two liver cancers. In HB LHX2 downregulation correlated with multiple poor outcome parameters including higher patient age, intermediate- and high-risk tumors and patients\u2019 survival. A forced expression of LHX2 reduced the proliferation, the migration and the survival of hepatoma cells in vitro through the inactivation of MAPK/ERK and Wnt signalings. In vivo, LHX2 impeded the development of tumors in the chick embryo and repressed the Wnt pathway in Xenopus embryo.

LHX2, a transcriptional factor member of the LIM homeobox gene family, has important functions in embryogenesis, liver development but also tumorigenesis. LHX2 is an oncogene in may solid tumors and leukemia but its role in liver cancer is unknown. To address this question we analyzed the expression of LHX2 in HCC and HB using various transcriptomic datasets and found a strong connection between LHX2 down-regulation and Wnt activation in these two liver cancers. In HB LHX2 downregulation correlated with multiple poor outcome parameters including higher patient age, intermediate- and high-risk tumors and patients\u2019 survival. A forced expression of LHX2 reduced the proliferation, the migration and the survival of hepatoma cells in vitro through the inactivation of MAPK/ERK and Wnt signalings.

Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls).

Several approved treatments, including immune therapy and multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are used for treatment, although the results are not optimum. There is an unmet need to develop highly effective chemotherapies for HCC. Targeting multiple pathways to attack cancer cells is beneficial. Cabozantinib is an orally available bioactive multikinase inhibitor and has a modest effect on HCC treatment. Silmitasertib is an orally bioavailable, potent CK2 inhibitor with a direct role in DNA damage repair and is in clinical trial for other cancers. In this study, we planned to repurpose these existing drugs on HCC treatment.  We observed stronger antiproliferative effect of these two combined drugs on HCC cells generated from different etiologies as compared to the single treatment. Global RNA-seq analyses revealed a decrease in the expression of G2/M cell cycle transition genes in HCC cells following combination treatment, suggesting G2 phase cell arrest. We observed G2/M cell cycle phase arrest in HCC cells upon combination treatment compared to the single-treated or vehicle-treated control cells.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Several approved treatments, including immune therapy and multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are used for treatment, although the results are not optimum. There is an unmet need to develop highly effective chemotherapies for HCC. Targeting multiple pathways to attack cancer cells is beneficial. Cabozantinib is an orally available bioactive multikinase inhibitor and has a modest effect on HCC treatment. Silmitasertib is an orally bioavailable, potent CK2 inhibitor with a direct role in DNA damage repair and is in clinical trial for other cancers. In this study, we planned to repurpose these existing drugs on HCC treatment. We observed stronger antiproliferative effect of these two combined drugs on HCC cells generated from different etiologies as compared to the single treatment. Global RNA-seq analyses revealed a decrease in the expression of G2/M cell cycle transition genes in HCC cells following combination treatment, suggesting G2 phase cell arrest.

Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.  Conclusion: This study proposes a miRNA-based biomarker classifier for SCLC that considers clinical demographics with specific cut offs to inform SCLC diagnosis."}, "LLM+CEDAR": {"geo_accession": "GSE235960", "gsm_accession": "GSM7512390", "title": "A non-canonical repressor function of JUN restrains YAP activity and suppresses YAP-dependent liver cancer growth [CUT&RUN]", "summary": "The transcriptional coactivators YAP/TAZ are the critical downstream regulators of the Hippo pathway that regulate gene expression in response to changes in pathway activity, mainly by binding to TEAD transcription factors.

In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples.

Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

Here, we report that TFAM deficiency rapidly and stably induced spontaneous lung metastasis in mice with liver cancer. Interestingly, unexpected polymerization of nuclear actin was observed in TFAM-knockdown HCC cells when cytoskeleton was examined. Polymerization of nuclear actin is causally linked to the high-metastatic ability of HCC cells by modulating chromatin accessibility and coordinating the expression of genes associated with extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis and cell migration. Mechanistically, TFAM deficiency blocked the TCA cycle and increased the intracellular malonyl-CoA levels. Malonylation of mDia2, which drives actin assembly, promotes its nuclear translocation.

Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."}, "LLM+CEDAR": {"geo_accession": "GSE189935", "gsm_accession": "GSM5710205", "title": "The fibroblast-centered cellular crosstalk in HBV-positive liver cancer revealed by single cell sequencing", "summary": "Here, we generated full-length single cell transcriptome data for ~9,000 cells from clinical samples of 11 liver cancer patients to delineate cellular relationships of diverse malignant, immune and stromal cells.

Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration. Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function. Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples.

However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples.

ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

{"BioSample": {"title": ["RNA helicase DDX5 mediates adaptive response to multi-kinase inhibitors in liver cancer"], "summary": ["Earlier studies linked sorafenib effectiveness to induction of ferroptosis. Herein we demonstrate sorafenib and mTKIs downregulate DDX5 in vitro and in vivo. To understand the effect of DDX5 downregulation, we compared TCGA-derived HCCs expressing low vs. high DDX5 focusing on ferroptosis-related genes. Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key ferroptosis regulator, was significantly overexpressed in DDX5LOW HCCs. Importantly, DDX5-knockdown (DDX5KD) HCC cell lines lacked lipid peroxidation by GPX4 inhibition, indicating DDX5 downregulation suppresses ferroptosis. RNAseq analyses comparing wild type vs. DDX5KD cells in the presence or absence of sorafenib, identified a unique set of genes repressed by DDX5 and upregulated by sorafenib. This set significantly overlaps genes from Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways, including NF-\u03baB inducing Kinase required for non-canonical NF-\u03baB activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of these pathways in combination with sorafenib reduced DDX5KD cell viability.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Previous studies identified substantial co-occupancy of YAP/TAZ and AP-1 at genomic sites, and they demonstrated that JUN/FOS heterodimers cooperate with the YAP/TAZ and TEAD transcription factors to drive YAP/TAZ target gene expression. Here, we now elucidate a negative feedback mechanism in which high YAP activity is restrained by the recruitment of homodimeric JUN::JUN/NCOR1 repressor complexes and show that this noncanonical JUN function is part of a tumor suppressor mechanism in the liver.", "organism": "NA", "age": "NA", "biomaterial_provider": "NA", "sex": "NA", "tissue": "liver", "cell_type": "breast epithelial", "cell_line": "MCF10A", "design": "NA", "disease": "liver cancer", "treatment": "doxycycline", "description": "NA"}}

B cells displayed distinct developmental trajectories in HCC and CRLM.

Functionally, IgG+ plasma cells preferentially promoted pro-tumorigenic macrophages formation in HCC, and IgA+ plasma cells preferentially induced granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells activation in CRLM. Clinically, increased infiltration of IgG+ plasma cells and macrophages in HCC was correlated to worse survival, while increased intratumoral IgA+ plasma cells and neutrophils in CRLM indicated poor prognosis.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples.

Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Mechanistically, SUMOylation induces a structural rearrangement of the RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that modulates HuR binding affinity to its target mRNAs further modifying the transcriptomic profile towards hepatic tumor progression.", "organism": "Homo sapiens", "age": "NA", "biomaterial_provider": "NA", "sex": "NA", "tissue": "Liver", "cell_type": "NA", "cell_line": "HuH-7", "design": "NA", "disease": "Hepatocellular carcinoma", "treatment": "NA", "description": "HuR [K120/182R] mutant expression"}}

Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset. Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients. Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples.

Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls).

Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset. Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients. Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.

However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples.
