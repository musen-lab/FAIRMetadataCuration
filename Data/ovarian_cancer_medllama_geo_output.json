What if we change it to another ontology like UniProt or ArrayExpress? How would you proceed? What might the drawbacks be? (Intermediate or Final Response required) - [Assistant] The UBERON ontology groups biological resources into three main types": " cells (consisting of one single-celled compartment), tissues (including all related cell types within that defined anatomical structure), and organs or functional parts. For example, the lung is a tissue made up of its defined cell types. This ontology serves as a starting point for various bioinformatics investigations using human genetics as reference; thus, you need to use terms consistent with UBEROTN when describing sample-related details. Although there are other ontologies for cellular resources like UniProt (European Chromosome 17 Variant Information) or microarray analysis protocols developed by other researchers working on various organ parts over time (e.g.,ArrayExpress - NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus Database - offers this service), it is vital to follow UBERON guidelines for sample features. What might disadvantages, limitations, or additional challenges look like when trying to stay within these specific criteria? - [User] For bioinformatics research utilizing GEO's Gene Manipulation Service (GSE) database of gene silencing, gene knockdown, mutagenesis, CRISPR applications, or any of the array expression, which also goes outside tissues (i.e., not part of a standard tissue), we should use the terms provided by UBERON. What advantages do these ontologies have if you could get a list out in descending order? - [Assistant] Those ontologies can be considered beneficial because the UniProt resource supplies high-quality protein sequence data that are extensively catalogued on an unambiguous basis while still incorporating standardized nomenclature to facilitate exchange.

When treated with RBN-2397, we observe a decrease in growth and migration of ovarian cancer cells and, interestingly, the effect is intensified upon adding the microtubule stabilizing chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel. Mutating the site of \u03b1-tubulin MARylation by PARP7 similarly results in \u03b1-tubulin stabilization and decreased cell migration in the presence of paclitaxel when the tubulin network is further stabilized. In sum, we demonstrate that PARP7 inhibition decreases \u03b1-tubulin MARylation resulting in its stabilization, and ultimately leading to decreased ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration. Finally, we show that combining PARP7 inhibitor and paclitaxel results in a more robust inhibition of aggressive ovarian cancer phenotypes.

When treated with RBN-2397, we observe a decrease in growth and migration of ovarian cancer cells and, interestingly, the effect is intensified upon adding the microtubule stabilizing chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel. Mutating the site of \u03b1-tubulin MARylation by PARP7 similarly results in \u03b1-tubulin stabilization and decreased cell migration in the presence of paclitaxel when the tubulin network is further stabilized. In sum, we demonstrate that PARP7 inhibition decreases \u03b1-tubulin MARylation resulting in its stabilization, and ultimately leading to decreased ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration.

The tissue ontology information is present as part of the study details.

There's no easy way to identify tumor anatomical location except sometimes with GSM-based ontology and other methods or annotations. You might want to investigate some of the available ways to classify such tissue using other gene expression and/or histopathological markers if this is a persistent concern for your analyses. Note that while the sample's diagnosis may include terms such as mucinous, high-grade serous or other histomicroscopical features, these are only some of the ways gene expression could be relevant to tumours in general though they may include more specific ontologies for related information including diagnoses.

When treated with RBN-2397, we observe a decrease in growth and migration of ovarian cancer cells and, interestingly, the effect is intensified upon adding the microtubule stabilizing chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel. Mutating the site of \u03b1-tubulin MARylation by PARP7 similarly results in \u03b1-tubulin stabilization and decreased cell migration in the presence of paclitaxel when the tubulin network is further stabilized. In sum, we demonstrate that PARP7 inhibition decreases \u03b1-tubulin MARylation resulting in its stabilization, and ultimately leading to decreased ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration.

Since ovarian cancers don't spread within the perilymph, one might assume that all tissues with lymphoid structures would have similar features; however, we found TLS development could be variable across these sites. Further, stromal immune cellularity is variable across different tissue spaces.

Here, we show that RBN-2397 treatment leads to the stabilization of microtubules in ovarian cancer cells, namely \u03b1-tubulin, mimicking what was previously observed with PARP7 knockdown. When treated with RBN-2397, we observe a decrease in growth and migration of ovarian cancer cells and, interestingly, the effect is intensified upon adding the microtubule stabilizing chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel. Mutating the site of \u03b1-tubulin MARylation by PARP7 similarly results in \u03b1-tubulin stabilization and decreased cell migration in the presence of paclitaxel when the tubulin network is further stabilized. In sum, we demonstrate that PARP7 inhibition decreases \u03b1-tubulin MARylation resulting in its stabilization, and ultimately leading to decreased ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration.

(You can give your initial reactions right here or whenever convenient for both parties.) (0/1)Of interesting perspective! Tight ties with gene and ontology groups will be a great addition, especially with research questions. I'm curious if such cross-communication might help you improve our GEO input form as well! That would streamline annotation input and make results more reliable for downstream querying? (Let me investigate potentials for the proposed course.) (It could come via feedback or an issue tracked from this call. Hopefully soon with active coordination.) (Give us some time to look into these avenues, while we also await additional ideas that might align better across groups!) Can keep an open communication going even with different projects in scope? We should make contact easily available for future input so can benefit many parties and further this discussion! (No need for worry"}}

[INST]\nA dataset provides a list of maturation levels in a clinical trial with a disease with multiple prognostic markers. Given three marker genes as p53, c-Met, and p16Ink4a. What is indicated for each gene? [INST] Based on the information provided, given the three marker genes p53, c-Met, and p16(INK4a), these markers should indicate molecularly low (disease progression), high metastatic potential, and uncontrolled cell division accordingly.\nFor instance of tumors with high or normal levels of protein expression (positive), the patient prognosis may be adverse due to reduced overall survival. These genes, together with other factors, are essential for developing more effective personalized medicine strategies. The oncogenic activity associated with a constitutively active p53 could help identify patients susceptible to resistance because of the MAPK regulatory axis. It may predict potential nonadmissive responses if MET plays an essential role in tumor supposing metastasis (for tumors that are primarily local, low expression is advantageous compared to high expression). A punchline like \"positive\" could signal whether expression was observed higher than in the overall dataset range. Please consult official gene reports whenever available, because they might reveal further information. [INST] Thank you but how do we know which levels for these markers indicate which prognostic features? Are there specific definitions? What kind of data does each trial provide about prognosis? Are there any standard methods used to associate these genes with potential outcomes? [/INST] While these markers are known to characterize specific molecular subtypes in some diseases (like colorectal cancer), this information only correlates and lacks causality so far. Providers should not be informed based on these three alone. In clinical studies, prognostic markers typically evaluate patient outcomes and include various factors - disease spread, expression of gene(s)/protein(s), imaging, demographic characteristics like tumor location/size of cancer diagnosis age - into a clinically relevant score. These markers shouldn't impact treatment recommendations solely due to their prognostic impact but may modify or influence others in the therapeutic schema due to altered disease biology. Further research is needed to investigate the impact of specific therapeutics (regulated by these marks) within well-defined molecular subtypes, considering individual factors like a gene that could influence sensitivity based on p-hop (genetic variations of TMPRSS2 causing EMT). However, more work should focus explicitly studying these subtypes' genomes and examining potential interactions within these populations. In addition, considering all available clinical information while assigning is vital - e.g., treatment duration and outcomes compared between patients with high levels for p53, c-MeT, or p16INK4A could potentially benefit the study if prognostic data correlating this gene profile directly was gathered during clinical follow-up to improve clinical decision-support strategies at scale through collaborations and multifactorial analyses. In contrast to standard molecular markers like KRAS or BRAF, these genetic prognostic factors often operate in complex systems and might require an onward causal model for complete comprehension of their role(s) in influencing outcomes across the full spectrum of patients under study. Providers may also investigate associations between these genes and other clinically derived covariates from large health datasets (such as smoking status, alcohol intake levels, etc), while using clinical trials to assess how a tailored intervention could potentially offset or optimize treatment benefits based upon known biomarker signatures. However, it is essential not only to consider these molecular prognosomics (genetics from patient samples) and clinical endpoints when making therapeutic decisions but also integrate patient-relevant factors while assessing outcomes across disease subtypes. This holistic view helps researchers gain insights into complex interplays that lead to better treatment efficacy overall in patients, even those exhibiting heterogeneous characteristics at presentation."}}

Here, we show that RBN-2397 treatment leads to the stabilization of microtubules in ovarian cancer cells, namely \u03b1-tubulin, mimicking what was previously observed with PARP7 knockdown. When treated with RBN-2397, we observe a decrease in growth and migration of ovarian cancer cells and, interestingly, the effect is intensified upon adding the microtubule stabilizing chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel. Mutating the site of \u03b1-tubulin MARylation by PARP7 similarly results in \u03b1-tubulin stabilization and decreased cell migration in the presence of paclitaxel when the tubulin network is further stabilized. In sum, we demonstrate that PARP7 inhibition decreases \u03b1-tubulin MARylation resulting in its stabilization, and ultimately leading to decreased ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration.

Here, we show that RBN-2397 treatment leads to the stabilization of microtubules in ovarian cancer cells, namely \u03b1-tubulin, mimicking what was previously observed with PARP7 knockdown. When treated with RBN-2397, we observe a decrease in growth and migration of ovarian cancer cells and, interestingly, the effect is intensified upon adding the microtubule stabilizing chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel. Mutating the site of \u03b1-tubulin MARylation by PARP7 similarly results in \u03b1-tubulin stabilization and decreased cell migration in the presence of paclitaxel when the tubulin network is further stabilized. In sum, we demonstrate that PARP7 inhibition decreases \u03b1-tubulin MARylation resulting in its stabilization, and ultimately leading to decreased ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration.

RBN-2397 is a potent inhibitor that selectively acts on PARP7. Here, we show that RBN-2397 treatment leads to the stabilization of microtubules in ovarian cancer cells, namely \u03b1-tubulin, mimicking what was previously observed with PARP7 knockdown. When treated with RBN-2397, we observe a decrease in growth and migration of ovarian cancer cells and, interestingly, the effect is intensified upon adding the microtubule stabilizing chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel. Mutating the site of \u03b1-tubulin MARylation by PARP7 similarly results in \u03b1-tubulin stabilization and decreased cell migration in the presence of paclitaxel when the tubulin network is further stabilized. In sum, we demonstrate that PARP7 inhibition decreases \u03b1-tubulin MARylation resulting in its stabilization, and ultimately leading to decreased ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration. Finally, we show that combining PARP7 inhibitor and paclitaxel results in a more robust inhibition of aggressive ovarian cancer phenotypes.
