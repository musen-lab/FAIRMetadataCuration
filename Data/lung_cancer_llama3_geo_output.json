ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression.

Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer.

The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted.

Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models.

As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment. The circulating transcriptome of LC patients represents a source of potential LC biomarkers. We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils.

SMARCA4 binds to gene loci encoding NE-lineage transcription factors ASCL1 and NEUROD1 and alters chromatin accessibility, suppressing NE programs. In parallel, SMARCA4 also controls REST, a known suppressor of the NE phenotype, by regulating SRRM4-dependent REST splicing. The SMARCA2/4 inhibitor FHD-286 induces loss of NE features and drives ERBB pathway activation in SCLC, rendering SCLC tumors sensitive to afatinib.

Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.

It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples.

It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples. These results indicate that the additional information of miRNA editing are useful in improving the classification of LUAD samples.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression.

Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Further results indicated that the function of PHD2 in NSCLC is dependent on its enzymatic activity and partially independent of HIF.

Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples.

Using a Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic analyses of TCs and immune cells (ICs) in spatially matched areas according to tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. Several findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed (IF) areas show up-regulation of pro-inflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient (ID) areas show up-regulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.

We observed increased fractions of exhausted CD8+ T cells, CCL18+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and LAMP3+ dendritic cells (DCs) in the immune component of NSCLC with COPD compared with the findings in NSCLC without COPD.

{"BioSample": {"title": ["Improved lung cancer classification by employing diverse molecular features of microRNAs"], "summary": ["Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common pathological and histological subtypes of primary lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls).

High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils.

It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively).

We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

SMARCA4 binds to gene loci encoding NE-lineage transcription factors ASCL1 and NEUROD1 and alters chromatin accessibility, suppressing NE programs. In parallel, SMARCA4 also controls REST, a known suppressor of the NE phenotype, by regulating SRRM4-dependent REST splicing.

We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils. Our results indicate that in whole blood, increased expression levels of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP are diagnostic and prognostic markers of late-stage LC."], "design": "", "gse": "GSE198048", "gsm": ["GSM5936875"], "tissue": "Whole blood", "technical_variation_adjustment": "1.02592337891285", "Sex": "female", "stage_groups": "Middle", "histology": "SCLC", "agescaled": "-0.407442731096034", "smokingstatus": "Ever", "survival": "12.8289473684211"}, "LLM": {"Blood": " Whole blood is a type of tissue, still, blood would follow  HCA (Histopath Cariovascular Annotation) standards for correct terminology, therefore"}, "LLM+CEDAR": {"'whole blood' does not directly translate the most obvious choice from UBERON ontology for humans.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples.

Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples.

Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response.

However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples.

Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.

High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively).

Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.
