        "summary": [
            "PARP7 (TiPARP), a mono (ADP-ribosyl) transferase (MART) was found to target \u03b1-tubulin proteins in ovarian cancer cells, enhancing their growth and migration. RBN-2397 is a potent inhibitor that selectively acts on PARP7. Here, we show that RBN-2397 treatment leads to the stabilization of microtubules in ovarian cancer cells, namely \u03b1-tubulin, mimicking what was previously observed with PARP7 knockdown. When treated with RBN-2397, we observe a decrease in growth and migration of ovarian cancer cells and, interestingly, the effect is intensified upon adding the microtubule stabilizing chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel. Mutating the site of \u03b1-tubulin MARylation by PARP7 similarly results in \u03b1-tubulin stabilization and decreased cell migration in the presence of paclitaxel when the tubulin network is further stabilized. In sum, we demonstrate that PARP7 inhibition decreases \u03b1-tubulin MARylation resulting in its stabilization, and ultimately leading to decreased ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration. Finally, we show that combining PARP7 inhibitor and paclitaxel results in a more robust inhibition of aggressive ovarian cancer phenotypes. Collectively, this study highlights the potential of targeting PARP7 in combination with established chemotherapeutic agents to enhance treatment efficacy for ovarian cancer."

        "summary": [
            "PARP7 (TiPARP), a mono (ADP-ribosyl) transferase (MART) was found to target \u03b1-tubulin proteins in ovarian cancer cells, enhancing their growth and migration. RBN-2397 is a potent inhibitor that selectively acts on PARP7. Here, we show that RBN-2397 treatment leads to the stabilization of microtubules in ovarian cancer cells, namely \u03b1-tubulin, mimicking what was previously observed with PARP7 knockdown. When treated with RBN-2397, we observe a decrease in growth and migration of ovarian cancer cells and, interestingly, the effect is intensified upon adding the microtubule stabilizing chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel. Mutating the site of \u03b1-tubulin MARylation by PARP7 similarly results in \u03b1-tubulin stabilization and decreased cell migration in the presence of paclitaxel when the tubulin network is further stabilized. In sum, we demonstrate that PARP7 inhibition decreases \u03b1-tubulin MARylation resulting in its stabilization, and ultimately leading to decreased ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration. Finally, we show that combining PARP7 inhibitor and paclitaxel results in a more robust inhibition of aggressive ovarian cancer phenotypes. Collectively, this study highlights the potential of targeting PARP7 in combination with established chemotherapeutic agents to enhance treatment efficacy for ovarian cancer."

Analysis of 64,097 cells identified NACT-induced overexpression of stabilin-1 (clever-1) on macrophages and FOXP3 in Tregs and these were validated at the protein level. STAB1 inhibition in vitro induced anti-tumor macrophages. FOXP3 anti-sense oligonucleotide (FOXP3-ASO), repolarised Tregs to an effector T cell phenotype.",

Combining chemotherapy with anti-stabilin1 antibody and/or Foxp3-ASO significantly increased survival of mice with established peritoneal disease in two HGSOC syngeneic models and progression-free survival in a third model. Long-term survivors (300 days+) were resistant to tumor rechallenge. Anti-stabilin1 antibody enriched the tumors with CXCL9+ macrophages and Foxp3-ASO increased TBET cell infiltration. Our results suggest targeting these molecules may improve chemotherapy response in patients.",

        "summary": [
            "PARP7 (TiPARP), a mono (ADP-ribosyl) transferase (MART) was found to target \u03b1-tubulin proteins in ovarian cancer cells, enhancing their growth and migration. RBN-2397 is a potent inhibitor that selectively acts on PARP7. Here, we show that RBN-2397 treatment leads to the stabilization of microtubules in ovarian cancer cells, namely \u03b1-tubulin, mimicking what was previously observed with PARP7 knockdown. When treated with RBN-2397, we observe a decrease in growth and migration of ovarian cancer cells and, interestingly, the effect is intensified upon adding the microtubule stabilizing chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel. Mutating the site of \u03b1-tubulin MARylation by PARP7 similarly results in \u03b1-tubulin stabilization and decreased cell migration in the presence of paclitaxel when the tubulin network is further stabilized. In sum, we demonstrate that PARP7 inhibition decreases \u03b1-tubulin MARylation resulting in its stabilization, and ultimately leading to decreased ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration. Finally, we show that combining PARP7 inhibitor and paclitaxel results in a more robust inhibition of aggressive ovarian cancer phenotypes. Collectively, this study highlights the potential of targeting PARP7 in combination with established chemotherapeutic agents to enhance treatment efficacy for ovarian cancer."

We interrogate TLS-adjacent stroma and assess how normal mesenchymal stem cells MSCs (nMSCs) may support B cell function and TLS, contrary to cancer-educated MSCs (CA-MSCs) which negate the prognostic benefit of our TLS signature, suggesting that pro-tumorigenic stroma could limit TLS formation."

        "summary": [
            "PARP7 (TiPARP), a mono (ADP-ribosyl) transferase (MART) was found to target \u03b1-tubulin proteins in ovarian cancer cells, enhancing their growth and migration. RBN-2397 is a potent inhibitor that selectively acts on PARP7. Here, we show that RBN-2397 treatment leads to the stabilization of microtubules in ovarian cancer cells, namely \u03b1-tubulin, mimicking what was previously observed with PARP7 knockdown. When treated with RBN-2397, we observe a decrease in growth and migration of ovarian cancer cells and, interestingly, the effect is intensified upon adding the microtubule stabilizing chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel. Mutating the site of \u03b1-tubulin MARylation by PARP7 similarly results in \u03b1-tubulin stabilization and decreased cell migration in the presence of paclitaxel when the tubulin network is further stabilized. In sum, we demonstrate that PARP7 inhibition decreases \u03b1-tubulin MARylation resulting in its stabilization, and ultimately leading to decreased ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration. Finally, we show that combining PARP7 inhibitor and paclitaxel results in a more robust inhibition of aggressive ovarian cancer phenotypes. Collectively, this study highlights the potential of targeting PARP7 in combination with established chemotherapeutic agents to enhance treatment efficacy for ovarian cancer."

            "PARP7 (TiPARP), a mono (ADP-ribosyl) transferase (MART) was found to target \u03b1-tubulin proteins in ovarian cancer cells, enhancing their growth and migration. RBN-2397 is a potent inhibitor that selectively acts on PARP7. Here, we show that RBN-2397 treatment leads to the stabilization of microtubules in ovarian cancer cells, namely \u03b1-tubulin, mimicking what was previously observed with PARP7 knockdown. When treated with RBN-2397, we observe a decrease in growth and migration of ovarian cancer cells and, interestingly, the effect is intensified upon adding the microtubule stabilizing chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel. Mutating the site of \u03b1-tubulin MARylation by PARP7 similarly results in \u03b1-tubulin stabilization and decreased cell migration in the presence of paclitaxel when the tubulin network is further stabilized. In sum, we demonstrate that PARP7 inhibition decreases \u03b1-tubulin MARylation resulting in its stabilization, and ultimately leading to decreased ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration. Finally, we show that combining PARP7 inhibitor and paclitaxel results in a more robust inhibition of aggressive ovarian cancer phenotypes. Collectively, this study highlights the potential of targeting PARP7 in combination with established chemotherapeutic agents to enhance treatment efficacy for ovarian cancer."

            "PARP7 (TiPARP), a mono (ADP-ribosyl) transferase (MART) was found to target \u03b1-tubulin proteins in ovarian cancer cells, enhancing their growth and migration. RBN-2397 is a potent inhibitor that selectively acts on PARP7. Here, we show that RBN-2397 treatment leads to the stabilization of microtubules in ovarian cancer cells, namely \u03b1-tubulin, mimicking what was previously observed with PARP7 knockdown. When treated with RBN-2397, we observe a decrease in growth and migration of ovarian cancer cells and, interestingly, the effect is intensified upon adding the microtubule stabilizing chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel. Mutating the site of \u03b1-tubulin MARylation by PARP7 similarly results in \u03b1-tubulin stabilization and decreased cell migration in the presence of paclitaxel when the tubulin network is further stabilized. In sum, we demonstrate that PARP7 inhibition decreases \u03b1-tubulin MARylation resulting in its stabilization, and ultimately leading to decreased ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration. Finally, we show that combining PARP7 inhibitor and paclitaxel results in a more robust inhibition of aggressive ovarian cancer phenotypes. Collectively, this study highlights the potential of targeting PARP7 in combination with established chemotherapeutic agents to enhance treatment efficacy for ovarian cancer."

Analysis of 64,097 cells identified NACT-induced overexpression of stabilin-1 (clever-1) on macrophages and FOXP3 in Tregs and these were validated at the protein level. STAB1 inhibition in vitro induced anti-tumor macrophages. FOXP3 anti-sense oligonucleotide (FOXP3-ASO), repolarised Tregs to an effector T cell phenotype.",
            "ScRNAseq on 69,781 cells from an HGSOC syngeneic mouse model recapitulated the patients\u2019 data. Combining chemotherapy with anti-stabilin1 antibody and/or Foxp3-ASO significantly increased survival of mice with established peritoneal disease in two HGSOC syngeneic models and progression-free survival in a third model. Long-term survivors (300 days+) were resistant to tumor rechallenge. Anti-stabilin1 antibody enriched the tumors with CXCL9+ macrophages and Foxp3-ASO increased TBET cell infiltration. Our results suggest targeting these molecules may improve chemotherapy response in patients.",

            "PARP7 (TiPARP), a mono (ADP-ribosyl) transferase (MART) was found to target \u03b1-tubulin proteins in ovarian cancer cells, enhancing their growth and migration. RBN-2397 is a potent inhibitor that selectively acts on PARP7. Here, we show that RBN-2397 treatment leads to the stabilization of microtubules in ovarian cancer cells, namely \u03b1-tubulin, mimicking what was previously observed with PARP7 knockdown. When treated with RBN-2397, we observe a decrease in growth and migration of ovarian cancer cells and, interestingly, the effect is intensified upon adding the microtubule stabilizing chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel. Mutating the site of \u03b1-tubulin MARylation by PARP7 similarly results in \u03b1-tubulin stabilization and decreased cell migration in the presence of paclitaxel when the tubulin network is further stabilized. In sum, we demonstrate that PARP7 inhibition decreases \u03b1-tubulin MARylation resulting in its stabilization, and ultimately leading to decreased ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration. Finally, we show that combining PARP7 inhibitor and paclitaxel results in a more robust inhibition of aggressive ovarian cancer phenotypes. Collectively, this study highlights the potential of targeting PARP7 in combination with established chemotherapeutic agents to enhance treatment efficacy for ovarian cancer."

Analysis of 64,097 cells identified NACT-induced overexpression of stabilin-1 (clever-1) on macrophages and FOXP3 in Tregs and these were validated at the protein level. STAB1 inhibition in vitro induced anti-tumor macrophages. FOXP3 anti-sense oligonucleotide (FOXP3-ASO), repolarised Tregs to an effector T cell phenotype.",
            "ScRNAseq on 69,781 cells from an HGSOC syngeneic mouse model recapitulated the patients\u2019 data. Combining chemotherapy with anti-stabilin1 antibody and/or Foxp3-ASO significantly increased survival of mice with established peritoneal disease in two HGSOC syngeneic models and progression-free survival in a third model. Long-term survivors (300 days+) were resistant to tumor rechallenge. Anti-stabilin1 antibody enriched the tumors with CXCL9+ macrophages and Foxp3-ASO increased TBET cell infiltration.

Analysis of 64,097 cells identified NACT-induced overexpression of stabilin-1 (clever-1) on macrophages and FOXP3 in Tregs and these were validated at the protein level. STAB1 inhibition in vitro induced anti-tumor macrophages. FOXP3 anti-sense oligonucleotide (FOXP3-ASO), repolarised Tregs to an effector T cell phenotype.",

Combining chemotherapy with anti-stabilin1 antibody and/or Foxp3-ASO significantly increased survival of mice with established peritoneal disease in two HGSOC syngeneic models and progression-free survival in a third model. Long-term survivors (300 days+) were resistant to tumor rechallenge. Anti-stabilin1 antibody enriched the tumors with CXCL9+ macrophages and Foxp3-ASO increased TBET cell infiltration.

            "PARP7 (TiPARP), a mono (ADP-ribosyl) transferase (MART) was found to target \u03b1-tubulin proteins in ovarian cancer cells, enhancing their growth and migration. RBN-2397 is a potent inhibitor that selectively acts on PARP7. Here, we show that RBN-2397 treatment leads to the stabilization of microtubules in ovarian cancer cells, namely \u03b1-tubulin, mimicking what was previously observed with PARP7 knockdown. When treated with RBN-2397, we observe a decrease in growth and migration of ovarian cancer cells and, interestingly, the effect is intensified upon adding the microtubule stabilizing chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel. Mutating the site of \u03b1-tubulin MARylation by PARP7 similarly results in \u03b1-tubulin stabilization and decreased cell migration in the presence of paclitaxel when the tubulin network is further stabilized. In sum, we demonstrate that PARP7 inhibition decreases \u03b1-tubulin MARylation resulting in its stabilization, and ultimately leading to decreased ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration. Finally, we show that combining PARP7 inhibitor and paclitaxel results in a more robust inhibition of aggressive ovarian cancer phenotypes. Collectively, this study highlights the potential of targeting PARP7 in combination with established chemotherapeutic agents to enhance treatment efficacy for ovarian cancer."

Analysis of 64,097 cells identified NACT-induced overexpression of stabilin-1 (clever-1) on macrophages and FOXP3 in Tregs and these were validated at the protein level. STAB1 inhibition in vitro induced anti-tumor macrophages. FOXP3 anti-sense oligonucleotide (FOXP3-ASO), repolarised Tregs to an effector T cell phenotype.",
            "ScRNAseq on 69,781 cells from an HGSOC syngeneic mouse model recapitulated the patients\u2019 data. Combining chemotherapy with anti-stabilin1 antibody and/or Foxp3-ASO significantly increased survival of mice with established peritoneal disease in two HGSOC syngeneic models and progression-free survival in a third model. Long-term survivors (300 days+) were resistant to tumor rechallenge. Anti-stabilin1 antibody enriched the tumors with CXCL9+ macrophages and Foxp3-ASO increased TBET cell infiltration. Our results suggest targeting these molecules may improve chemotherapy response in patients.",

            "Disease recurrence following chemotherapy is a major clinical challenge in ovarian cancer (OC) but little is known regarding how the tumour epigenome regulates transcriptional programs underpinning chemoresistance. We determined the single cell chromatin accessibility landscape of omental OC metastasis from treatment na\u00efve and neoadjuvant chemotherapy-treated patients and defined the chromatin accessibility profiles of epithelial, fibroblast, myeloid and lymphoid cells. Epithelial tumour cells displayed open chromatin regions enriched with motifs for the oncogenic transcription factors MEIS and PBX. Chemotherapy drove profound tumour heterogeneity and selection for cells with accessible chromatin enriched for TP53, TP63 and resistance-pathway-activating TF motifs. Nuclear receptors RORa, NR2F6 and HNF4NG were identified as candidate transcriptional drivers of stress-associated chemotherapy resistance whilst closure of binding sites for E2F2 and E2F4 indicated low proliferative capacity of resistant tumour subsets. Delineation of the epigenetic landscape of chemoresistant ovarian cancer therefore reveals core transcriptional regulators of chemoresistance and identifies potential novel therapeutic approaches for improving clinical outcome."

Analysis of 64,097 cells identified NACT-induced overexpression of stabilin-1 (clever-1) on macrophages and FOXP3 in Tregs and these were validated at the protein level. STAB1 inhibition in vitro induced anti-tumor macrophages. FOXP3 anti-sense oligonucleotide (FOXP3-ASO), repolarised Tregs to an effector T cell phenotype.",

Combining chemotherapy with anti-stabilin1 antibody and/or Foxp3-ASO significantly increased survival of mice with established peritoneal disease in two HGSOC syngeneic models and progression-free survival in a third model. Long-term survivors (300 days+) were resistant to tumor rechallenge. Anti-stabilin1 antibody enriched the tumors with CXCL9+ macrophages and Foxp3-ASO increased TBET cell infiltration.

Analysis of 64,097 cells identified NACT-induced overexpression of stabilin-1 (clever-1) on macrophages and FOXP3 in Tregs and these were validated at the protein level. STAB1 inhibition in vitro induced anti-tumor macrophages. FOXP3 anti-sense oligonucleotide (FOXP3-ASO), repolarised Tregs to an effector T cell phenotype.",
            "ScRNAseq on 69,781 cells from an HGSOC syngeneic mouse model recapitulated the patients\u2019 data. Combining chemotherapy with anti-stabilin1 antibody and/or Foxp3-ASO significantly increased survival of mice with established peritoneal disease in two HGSOC syngeneic models and progression-free survival in a third model. Long-term survivors (300 days+) were resistant to tumor rechallenge. Anti-stabilin1 antibody enriched the tumors with CXCL9+ macrophages and Foxp3-ASO increased TBET cell infiltration.

            "PARP7 (TiPARP), a mono (ADP-ribosyl) transferase (MART) was found to target \u03b1-tubulin proteins in ovarian cancer cells, enhancing their growth and migration. RBN-2397 is a potent inhibitor that selectively acts on PARP7. Here, we show that RBN-2397 treatment leads to the stabilization of microtubules in ovarian cancer cells, namely \u03b1-tubulin, mimicking what was previously observed with PARP7 knockdown. When treated with RBN-2397, we observe a decrease in growth and migration of ovarian cancer cells and, interestingly, the effect is intensified upon adding the microtubule stabilizing chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel. Mutating the site of \u03b1-tubulin MARylation by PARP7 similarly results in \u03b1-tubulin stabilization and decreased cell migration in the presence of paclitaxel when the tubulin network is further stabilized. In sum, we demonstrate that PARP7 inhibition decreases \u03b1-tubulin MARylation resulting in its stabilization, and ultimately leading to decreased ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration. Finally, we show that combining PARP7 inhibitor and paclitaxel results in a more robust inhibition of aggressive ovarian cancer phenotypes. Collectively, this study highlights the potential of targeting PARP7 in combination with established chemotherapeutic agents to enhance treatment efficacy for ovarian cancer."

Analysis of 64,097 cells identified NACT-induced overexpression of stabilin-1 (clever-1) on macrophages and FOXP3 in Tregs and these were validated at the protein level. STAB1 inhibition in vitro induced anti-tumor macrophages. FOXP3 anti-sense oligonucleotide (FOXP3-ASO), repolarised Tregs to an effector T cell phenotype.",

Combining chemotherapy with anti-stabilin1 antibody and/or Foxp3-ASO significantly increased survival of mice with established peritoneal disease in two HGSOC syngeneic models and progression-free survival in a third model. Long-term survivors (300 days+) were resistant to tumor rechallenge. Anti-stabilin1 antibody enriched the tumors with CXCL9+ macrophages and Foxp3-ASO increased TBET cell infiltration.

            "Disease recurrence following chemotherapy is a major clinical challenge in ovarian cancer (OC) but little is known regarding how the tumour epigenome regulates transcriptional programs underpinning chemoresistance. We determined the single cell chromatin accessibility landscape of omental OC metastasis from treatment na\u00efve and neoadjuvant chemotherapy-treated patients and defined the chromatin accessibility profiles of epithelial, fibroblast, myeloid and lymphoid cells. Epithelial tumour cells displayed open chromatin regions enriched with motifs for the oncogenic transcription factors MEIS and PBX. Chemotherapy drove profound tumour heterogeneity and selection for cells with accessible chromatin enriched for TP53, TP63 and resistance-pathway-activating TF motifs. Nuclear receptors RORa, NR2F6 and HNF4NG were identified as candidate transcriptional drivers of stress-associated chemotherapy resistance whilst closure of binding sites for E2F2 and E2F4 indicated low proliferative capacity of resistant tumour subsets. Delineation of the epigenetic landscape of chemoresistant ovarian cancer therefore reveals core transcriptional regulators of chemoresistance and identifies potential novel therapeutic approaches for improving clinical outcome."

            "Disease recurrence following chemotherapy is a major clinical challenge in ovarian cancer (OC) but little is known regarding how the tumour epigenome regulates transcriptional programs underpinning chemoresistance. We determined the single cell chromatin accessibility landscape of omental OC metastasis from treatment na\u00efve and neoadjuvant chemotherapy-treated patients and defined the chromatin accessibility profiles of epithelial, fibroblast, myeloid and lymphoid cells. Epithelial tumour cells displayed open chromatin regions enriched with motifs for the oncogenic transcription factors MEIS and PBX. Chemotherapy drove profound tumour heterogeneity and selection for cells with accessible chromatin enriched for TP53, TP63 and resistance-pathway-activating TF motifs. Nuclear receptors RORa, NR2F6 and HNF4NG were identified as candidate transcriptional drivers of stress-associated chemotherapy resistance whilst closure of binding sites for E2F2 and E2F4 indicated low proliferative capacity of resistant tumour subsets. Delineation of the epigenetic landscape of chemoresistant ovarian cancer therefore reveals core transcriptional regulators of chemoresistance and identifies potential novel therapeutic approaches for improving clinical outcome."

            "Disease recurrence following chemotherapy is a major clinical challenge in ovarian cancer (OC) but little is known regarding how the tumour epigenome regulates transcriptional programs underpinning chemoresistance. We determined the single cell chromatin accessibility landscape of omental OC metastasis from treatment na\u00efve and neoadjuvant chemotherapy-treated patients and defined the chromatin accessibility profiles of epithelial, fibroblast, myeloid and lymphoid cells. Epithelial tumour cells displayed open chromatin regions enriched with motifs for the oncogenic transcription factors MEIS and PBX. Chemotherapy drove profound tumour heterogeneity and selection for cells with accessible chromatin enriched for TP53, TP63 and resistance-pathway-activating TF motifs. Nuclear receptors RORa, NR2F6 and HNF4NG were identified as candidate transcriptional drivers of stress-associated chemotherapy resistance whilst closure of binding sites for E2F2 and E2F4 indicated low proliferative capacity of resistant tumour subsets. Delineation of the epigenetic landscape of chemoresistant ovarian cancer therefore reveals core transcriptional regulators of chemoresistance and identifies potential novel therapeutic approaches for improving clinical outcome."

            "PARP7 (TiPARP), a mono (ADP-ribosyl) transferase (MART) was found to target \u03b1-tubulin proteins in ovarian cancer cells, enhancing their growth and migration. RBN-2397 is a potent inhibitor that selectively acts on PARP7. Here, we show that RBN-2397 treatment leads to the stabilization of microtubules in ovarian cancer cells, namely \u03b1-tubulin, mimicking what was previously observed with PARP7 knockdown. When treated with RBN-2397, we observe a decrease in growth and migration of ovarian cancer cells and, interestingly, the effect is intensified upon adding the microtubule stabilizing chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel. Mutating the site of \u03b1-tubulin MARylation by PARP7 similarly results in \u03b1-tubulin stabilization and decreased cell migration in the presence of paclitaxel when the tubulin network is further stabilized. In sum, we demonstrate that PARP7 inhibition decreases \u03b1-tubulin MARylation resulting in its stabilization, and ultimately leading to decreased ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration. Finally, we show that combining PARP7 inhibitor and paclitaxel results in a more robust inhibition of aggressive ovarian cancer phenotypes. Collectively, this study highlights the potential of targeting PARP7 in combination with established chemotherapeutic agents to enhance treatment efficacy for ovarian cancer."

        "summary": [
            "PARP7 (TiPARP), a mono (ADP-ribosyl) transferase (MART) was found to target \u03b1-tubulin proteins in ovarian cancer cells, enhancing their growth and migration. RBN-2397 is a potent inhibitor that selectively acts on PARP7. Here, we show that RBN-2397 treatment leads to the stabilization of microtubules in ovarian cancer cells, namely \u03b1-tubulin, mimicking what was previously observed with PARP7 knockdown. When treated with RBN-2397, we observe a decrease in growth and migration of ovarian cancer cells and, interestingly, the effect is intensified upon adding the microtubule stabilizing chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel. Mutating the site of \u03b1-tubulin MARylation by PARP7 similarly results in \u03b1-tubulin stabilization and decreased cell migration in the presence of paclitaxel when the tubulin network is further stabilized. In sum, we demonstrate that PARP7 inhibition decreases \u03b1-tubulin MARylation resulting in its stabilization, and ultimately leading to decreased ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration. Finally, we show that combining PARP7 inhibitor and paclitaxel results in a more robust inhibition of aggressive ovarian cancer phenotypes. Collectively, this study highlights the potential of targeting PARP7 in combination with established chemotherapeutic agents to enhance treatment efficacy for ovarian cancer."

STAB1 inhibition in vitro induced anti-tumor macrophages. FOXP3 anti-sense oligonucleotide (FOXP3-ASO), repolarised Tregs to an effector T cell phenotype.",

        "summary": [
            "PARP7 (TiPARP), a mono (ADP-ribosyl) transferase (MART) was found to target \u03b1-tubulin proteins in ovarian cancer cells, enhancing their growth and migration. RBN-2397 is a potent inhibitor that selectively acts on PARP7. Here, we show that RBN-2397 treatment leads to the stabilization of microtubules in ovarian cancer cells, namely \u03b1-tubulin, mimicking what was previously observed with PARP7 knockdown. When treated with RBN-2397, we observe a decrease in growth and migration of ovarian cancer cells and, interestingly, the effect is intensified upon adding the microtubule stabilizing chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel. Mutating the site of \u03b1-tubulin MARylation by PARP7 similarly results in \u03b1-tubulin stabilization and decreased cell migration in the presence of paclitaxel when the tubulin network is further stabilized. In sum, we demonstrate that PARP7 inhibition decreases \u03b1-tubulin MARylation resulting in its stabilization, and ultimately leading to decreased ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration. Finally, we show that combining PARP7 inhibitor and paclitaxel results in a more robust inhibition of aggressive ovarian cancer phenotypes. Collectively, this study highlights the potential of targeting PARP7 in combination with established chemotherapeutic agents to enhance treatment efficacy for ovarian cancer."
