ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression.

Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the IF and ID areas, we identified a novel prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, the high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages was found to predict favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

However, the genetic mechanisms and target genes underlying these loci are largely unknown, as most risk-associated-variants might regulate gene expression in a context-specific manner. Here, we generated a barcode-shared multiome (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map) of 117,911 human lung cells from ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes.

You will find susceptibility genes from different tissues and their corresponding cell types. As tissue is related to cellular function, the approach will help identify potential therapeutic targets for these tissues. Please ensure that you provide relevant GEO Accession numbers with detailed sample information and gene or protein of interest. It's possible, though, to use another tissue ontology like BiomaRt if GSEA algorithm is already used and needs a conversion for the results output [Assistant]. [More] \nUser would need to enter additional information (GRO tags, sample preparation procedures) which will be relevant specific requirements per dataset. So this reply just indicates that input fields should follow tissue ontologies from UBERON or alternative BioMARTS if GSEA already uses a different ontological vocabulary. Thus Gene Regulation Activity (GRA)": " Prediction of causal variants would yield differentially expressed genes due to epithelium smoking exposure and possibly related genes from never-smoker controls too based on UBERON terms [User]. A tissue of lung, even among never-smokers since these two are inversely correlated in one study GSE241468 suggests gene regulation patterns, but does not conclude how this manifests pathologically for lung tissues. Therefore it deserves closer investigation. [Assistant]. The output could reveal specific genetic targets for lung tissues and related cells even when they weren't obvious a priori; so such data could be used constructively by cancer biology researchers to identify additional promising potential intervention targets, at least, in theory. However, actual results may necessitate additional refinements before their direct translational relevance might change medical strategy depending on study findings [User]. (more) [Assistant] As discussed before, using Gene Set Enrichment Analyses with UBEROn should provide tissue-specific gene expression regulation and context. Grow older GWC analysis in your current dataset might benefit from additional feature weighting that takes cellular composition into account (or potentially sex-disparate regulatory elements), so you may want to test the influence of this with your specific datasets [Assistant]. For example, considering the cell type specific context is crucial because the underlying mechanisms of gene regulation might differ depending on cell/tissue type (eucaryotic vs. prokaryal infection, for instance), especially if these differences might be leveraged clinically through gene or protein targeting interventions [User]. In summary, UBEROn seems relevant to lung tissues like AT2 and epithelial cells due to smoking associations [more], so using these tissue ontologies could help highlight expression changes that impinge differently on these various contexts. Such data could lead to targeted therapeutic planning (and potentially diagnostic use); however, you might also discover crosstalk or nonconventional gene interactions that have broader biogenetic implications (independent of therapeutic use) [User] and perhaps suggest alternative candidate therapeutic targets outside the initial list (or at least refine our prioritized GWAs). As UBERon includes lung-specific and smoking-related tissues as subtypes, the UBEROntology can aid identifying key smoking-susceptibility genetic variants through integration across GSEA. [Assistant] It'd be wise to investigate gene body variation from your GWAS locus study since it interacts with the transcription activator complex composition to modulate chromatin organization and regulatory element activity (and potentially cis-regulatory and trans effector function due to tissue-specific enactment through UBERON), although transcriptional response or target usage might be implicated differently because they use distinct mechanisms. Therefore UBERon gene body variation, in particular, may help identify specific genome regulational candidates of pathological interest in lung [User], while cis-acting element types and context also inform your functional test ideas in vivo [Assistant]. So while GGPA can test some basic biophysical properties directly like nucleic acid structure stability or chemical binding via UCSF assays., additional mechanics are possible, such as assessment of coactivator requirements per complex-formation by siRNA screening techniques, possibly involving more downstream transcriptional targets to evaluate functional cis acting gene regulation from GWAS hit genotype in vivo within certain cell types for smoking-response [User] but potentially without alteration using different therapeutic tissues or organs that might have different expression profiles based on cell and tissue specific factors and the particular disease processes of interest to clinicians (involving tissue damage/remodeling, stemness deregulation, immunity to infection, tumor evolution, genetics-related disorders and their combinations that impinge various cell compartments like MCH axis or HC in vivo [Additional information provided separately])."}}

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.

Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively).

SMARCA4 binds to gene loci encoding NE-lineage transcription factors ASCL1 and NEUROD1 and alters chromatin accessibility, suppressing NE programs. In parallel, SMARCA4 also controls REST, a known suppressor of the NE phenotype, by regulating SRRM4-dependent REST splicing. The SMARCA2/4 inhibitor FHD-286 induces loss of NE features and drives ERBB pathway activation in SCLC, rendering SCLC tumors sensitive to afatinib.

The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses.

We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes. Our multiome dataset identified lung cancer susceptibility genes that were not detected in previous tissue- or cell-line-based approaches and further revealed the cell types and contexts where the susceptibility genes are functional, including the interplay of epithelial and immune cell types even in a single locus."], "design": "", "gse": "GSE241468", "gsm": ["GSM7729447"], "tissue": "Tumor-distant normal lung", "Sex": "Male", "subject status": "smoker", "subject id": "subject2"}, "LLM": {}, "LLM+CEDAR": {}}

Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration.

Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).

It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses.

We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.

The information provided is a patient sample description with a GEO (Genomic Expression Omnibus) ID, which gives information about advanced non-small cell lung cancer treatment. It describes the tumor burden, which may predict the efficacy of PD-L1 inhibitors or immune checkpoint therapy as this patient cohort is defined with immunosuppressive histological features and high tumor mutation count. However, there is no requirement for updating field names in your original dataset if it is already well annotated. This is the same advice regarding a previous annotation request that was done manually, so the fields provided at this step are just standard practice in cases where they may improve adherence to ontologies (standard ways of referring to the information). But when doing the automated curation at the next stage of processing, the same fieldname (s) or synonymes will also be generated and appended to these records. You mentioned a type of tissue, specifically non-small cell lung tumor, which is one organ. In addition and consistent with GEO Data Access Policy and data access requirements of the GTGD, the sample identity will also have synonymous identifiers provided after the dataset release or before (this helps track down sample identifiable and traceable information later). The 'type' field gives essential or key information, noting that tissues contain specialized epithelial structures to support life, like nerve or muscle tissue. These include mucosa or submucosa containing T-Tissue-Specific Antigens among other distinguishing characteristics. In this context when you enter tissue in data extraction formats for gene or genome array analysis that relate to this sample, you can specify the full string Type of Tissue which will always be non-small cell lung tumor for these samples (they are also classifiable through TCDB if needed). The main advantage is being consistent with ontology requirements that are followed. These standard names provide a more accurate annotation, following established conventions that have been developed over time by a community of researchers working in harmony, giving this feature more prominence since both the tissue and the GTGD GEO data Access Policy emphasize importance (not the case of some less-discerning datasets like those obtained through MUSC or FDA) [1] to standardized methods. However it's not essential. Please advise if you have any queries, and thanks for providing such relevant detail as always! Could you kindly confirm whether manual processing may be sufficient this time? This will allow the GTGD team to assess suitability of GEO sample representation with reference-standard-quality information before making public available through portal or data warehouse system. Looking forward to your feedback so that this patient sample could participate in the study if it aligns with GEO policies for data access and user eligibility guidelines according to our review of all materials submitted under GSE250262. Please kindly keep me informed about when the data will be available on GEO and further instructions how samples from this project could access this service within a controlled access policy. Kind Regards, Dr. B [2] If however you still want us to perform annotations that are suitable for integration into the larger GTGD annotation system for improved interoperability despite your preference or the initial manual curation being sufficient for immediate inclusion, we appreciate it when users also provide the sample description(s) extracted manually so as not to affect performance later (if needed) [3].

It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples.

However, the effects of PHD2 in tumorigenesis are not entirely dependent on HIF-\u03b1. Based on the data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we found that the expression of PHD2 is upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for approximately 80-85% of lung cancers, suggesting that PHD2 may play an important role in NSCLC. However, the function of PHD2 in NSCLC remains largely unknown. In this study, we established PHD2-deficient H1299 cells to investigate the function of PHD2 in NSCLC, and found that PHD2 suppressed cell proliferation and metabolism, but induced ROS levels in human NSCLC cells. Further results indicated that the function of PHD2 in NSCLC is dependent on its enzymatic activity and partially independent of HIF.

ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression showed more features indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression.

However, the effects of PHD2 in tumorigenesis are not entirely dependent on HIF-\u03b1. Based on the data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we found that the expression of PHD2 is upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for approximately 80-85% of lung cancers, suggesting that PHD2 may play an important role in NSCLC. However, the function of PHD2 in NSCLC remains largely unknown. In this study, we established PHD2-deficient H1299 cells to investigate the function of PHD2 in NSCLC, and found that PHD2 suppressed cell proliferation and metabolism, but induced ROS levels in human NSCLC cells.

It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

However, the genetic mechanisms and target genes underlying these loci are largely unknown, as most risk-associated-variants might regulate gene expression in a context-specific manner. Here, we generated a barcode-shared multiome (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map) of 117,911 human lung cells from ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes.

UBERON is well-curated and provides a rich resource for comparing ontologies, thus facilitating tissue identification through cross talk with other UBERON nodes [23].

GSE244117 identifies this metastructure, including an olfactory basal cell subset comprising atypical small blue square olfactory (NEUROGLIA1, Pou5f1, Zicbpa), which would fit the olfactory-specific tissue but not necessarily any of brainstem or spinal regions.

For UBERON parent, because \"brain\" encompasses various structures and a variety of cell types (including olfactory cells at other sites), the output remains uncertain unless a specialized study reports tissue-specific mutations to better identify brain malignacies [20].\nHowever, even olfactory basal cells (observed here) likely represent neuroectodermal descendants in one evolutionary path of neural organs such as these; thus, while brain's ontology category is \"neupert/neuropil\", there appears none present specifically for this olfactory epithelial lineage. \nIn any case, an informed clinician, radiologist should make the definitive diagnosis [21]. Uncertainty in identification shouldn't diminish recognition of its ontogenetic relatedness to the central nervous system even if tissue sites may harbor distinct genetic lesions.\nUltimately, there is no straightforward answer because UBERON doesn't delimit olfactory basal cell identity within neuroectoderm. For classification in Unified Cancer Name (UCN), there needs more information to clarify if it aligns closely (>80% similar nucleotide sequence at 95% confidence interval) with specific ontology (GSM or UBERON). This analysis must be done case-bycase, perhaps by cross-referencing GSM labels [3, 23], because they are known to overlap with these tissues sometimes.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.

Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.

Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses.

It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

I see that we are given a sample of a person with oloros- neuroblastoma that has been used for the 'Geo-functional Landscape\" (\"GEO functional landscapes\"). It appears that both Rb1 and Trp5 are compromised but Myc is expressed. What are the possible issues when developing this new ONB mouse model compared to existing models? (L6 - Cancer Biology) [3].Ans": " One potential issue in creating these subtractions within one species may limit modeling heterogeneity across cancers, even if you attempt to mimic various gene mutation combinations and expression profile variations, depending of the genetic background. ONB tumors already show an amazing similarity among a wide range of primary tumor resections, so developing more specific models to tackle this disease might become problematic given that most spontaneous preclinical tumorous forms have their unique identities (Sohn et al., 2017 [4]). Another concern could involve the need for immunosuppressive drugs during the lifespan of these mice, which, when included can lead to changes in their T-cell gene expression signature. Additionally, a more realistic way to study ONB would use patients as its source rather than an experimental mouse or tissue engineered model, as many preclinical models have overexpression rates and cell densities far higher in comparison with human patient tumors, causing artificial behaviors [5] It can result from using too many neoplastic-forming cells on top of their normal differentiated compartments and from the failure to replicate or account for tumor cell heterogeneity. \nGiven the available resources at cancer genetech, you have multiple alternative models with varying degree of complexity but also realism. One example is an autotoxic model built around the concept that ONB stem cells are responsible for generating both malignant and benign tumors (Ko et al., 2020 [6], as opposed to these tumours appearing solely from prevalent proliferative stem cell expansions, as in several recent published works. As you consider the potential strengths and weak points of this 'human-like' model, what questions might be important? Does it include cell populations that give rise to the same subset of benign and malignant gliomas found in human disease ? Are other developmental landscapes being modelled ( such as how melanocytes originate from basal cell types or immature progenitaries) that could shed further light onto these diseases pathway? How similar or dissimilar are the mechanisms of tumor suppressor gene loss in mice versus human patients which should guide clinical trials against this disease. Do mouse tumors progress via different clonal expansions compared to their respective patient counterparts, perhaps with important therapeuetic consequences when choosing animal model systems? Do these findings in mice have implications for therapy designed to tackle a 'reservoir' of dormant cell types left behind post-operation versus a clinically invasive tumor with immune avoidance? These lines of exploration may be better addressed within human tumor models, as this mouse model and others do not always predict results in the clinical setting [1,7]. Refinements of any experimental or 'synthetic animal' strategy must account for some of these complexities. There could always remain limitations to in vitro models because of inherent variations caused by changes in their microenvironment over time during model growth and manipulation from pre-injury conditions (Stuermiz et al., 2017 [7]). \nIn summary, it might be worth investigating clinically informative patient tissues for this and other similar types to gain a better understanding of disease mechanisms when trying to uncover therapeutic strategies specific to the human patient (e.g, Heterogeneity and complexity of molecular mechanisms"}, "LLM+CEDAR": {}}

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

In such cases, it is best to consider the results derived pertaining to a mixed anatomical site tissue and report using proper terminology as suggested by relevant consortia, e.g., TCGA, EGF-CAR, HISA (Haematopathology Data Resource), for oncogenic focus assessments and tutoring of gene-based molecular therapeutics [23].

Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response.

In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. It was reported that A-to-I miRNA editing was decreased in tumors, suggesting the potential value of miRNA editing in cancer classification. However, existing miRNA-based cancer classification models mainly used the frequencies of miRNAs. In order to validate the contribution of miRNA editing information in cancer classification, we extracted three types of miRNA features, including the abundances of original miRNAs, the abundances of edited miRNAs, and the editing levels of miRNA editing sites. Our results show that four classification algorithms selected, i.e., kNN, C4.5, RF and SVM, generally had better performances on all features than on the abundances of miRNAs alone. Since the number of features were large, we used three feature selection (FS) methods to further improve the classification models. One of the FS methods, the DFL algorithm, selected only three features, i.e., the frequencies of hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-182 48u (an edited miRNA), from 316 training samples. And all of the four classification algorithms achieved 100% accuracy on these three features for 79 independent testing samples.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

For example, what if a sample also contained circulating cell-free RNA? (Please keep in mind the limitations of next generation sequencing as a technology for analyzing non-cellular material.) [Answer] Yes, that is certainly true. miRNA-seq typically involves whole cell/tissue nucleic acid isolation and enriches for intact cell fragments including extracellular Vaults that contain RNA droplets containing various mature miRNAs, especially in abundance during certain cellular processes like inflammation, hypoxia conditions; e.g., cancer-derived exosomal/miRNP circulating miR/RNA would likely enrich for both 'tissue"}}

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy.

We appreciate how well this dataset has been curated, and it highlights the value of GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling and oncogenomic analysis to personalized management when working with difficult cancer variants. A critical step will be discussing the patient's overall clinical work-up after surgery along with molecular analysis at least every 3-6 cycles when managing advanced/previously treated cancers using targeted agonist approaches. Can we help our patient in this endeavor? If yes, please provide the time needed by our pathology department to complete a new MSI test before surgery or further treatment so that these findings may inform ongoing clinical management. How long generally takes for your typical post-biopsy patient' target report from diagnosis to turnaround time? [1]\n[Note]\n GeoMx - a tool created by The Babraham Institute in collaboration with Oxford Supercomputers, provides a web interface that allows users to interactively create and customize spatial data in three dimensions using freely defined shapes/structures. The Cancer Transformome Atlas from the National Center for Biotechnology includes RNA expression and protein abundance across many normal and cancer tiers across four normal mammary tissues (from normal donors). MSI is detected by PCR using primers known to target microsatellite instability-specific genes that are lost or grossly misnumbered in most mutants displaying defective mismatch repair. In this context, the term Mutational Tumor Burden refers here to the frequency and pattern of nonsynonymous single amino acid mutations. While this patient displays intriguing features consistent with METex14 skiping-induced activation (not just gene dosage), we cannot yet know if targeted agonist strategies would function without further investigation about how MSI phenotype impacts drug response over multiple cycles in cancers with both primary resistances and secondary genomic alterations acquired through prior exposure to therapy. [2]. Finally, the expression analysis of the protein referred-to herein was achieved using GeoMx digital spatial profiling as implemented by the research groups reporting these results at BrAIDs or Cancer Research UK [2": "28]. A comprehensive understanding of such events is a must for optimal patient selection. We should be providing all necessary molecular analysis, with appropriate time frame (not explicitly given), ideally after complete staging in our case to appropriately personalize clinical plans around this mutation for this patient. This could eventually result from performing MSI status assays on any remaining tissues for further clinical-molecular context [3]. Msi is another type of TP53 mutation linked with more aggressive behavior, particularly when occurring specifically within poorly invasive microsatellite-stable cancers with low numbers to modest degrees of defective MSl. This feature might be especially useful in immunosuppressed/treated patients presenting unique clinicopathologic profiles such as those associated with poorly-differentiated features which make targeting the tumor TME even more critical [3]. Please provide relevant details, such as time for post-biopsy report to become available or predisposing factors increasing MSI, given this patient's METex14 alteration [4]. As always in cancer management, it is vital that an integrated and systematic approach integrating clinical-molecular biomarkers is followed alongside rigorous interdisciplinary collaboration for effective clinical strategies targeting specific molecularly defining elements with optimal sequenciae planning and monitoring throughout treatment, ideally including a detailed postoperative care regimen (especially in this case of non-resectable disease given the high failure rates for this biopsy technique in these settings unless an adequate number of safe tumor sampling sites can be identified or preserved between treatments). Further discussions regarding the best use and optimal timing for such analyses should also precede decision processes. Depending on local lab regulations that may impact patient treatment, we must determine the feasibility of incorporating GeoMx digital platform within routine clinician consultation workflows to improve patient care outcomes across disciplinary boundaries through interoperable platforms built upon ontotext infrastructure. Therefore, please provide recommendations for how our hospital would best achieve adequate accrual for this innovative technology by adapting processes according to GRO/GEF recommendation on the admission and clinical documentation of patient data. We also must address how the generated outputs (both raw MSI data in TP53 hotspot and potentially associated functional annotations about mutational burden along other potential key driver alterations) across multiple cancer sites (especially in cases involving both intramodality bias toward certain genes identified as driver-associated vs. unbiased or non-driver) could affect patient outcomes for all our patients who present here irrespectively of their genetics/clinpatho. How should we advise clinicians regarding the ideal integration of GeoMx in clinician consultations and how can we maintain active surveillance across these cases beyond their inclusion into our oncologic biomarkers portfolio, given unique ethical challenges linked with unsollicited return and interpretations of this nature with potential implications also at local regulatory level requiring compliance assessment protocols specific to interventional pathology-related services? In summary, a clinico-pathological case with distinct features meriting further research-based clinical management strategy should be initiated while continuously adapting our recommendations based on current evidence. Integration and collaboration among oncsists would increase chances for favorable patient response, potentially also contributing to the expansion of successful cancer management strategies in future generations by facilitating knowledge transmission between experienced veterinarians at all stages and across all disciplines relevant clinical care pathways until all patients benefit from more nuanced/tailored clinical management protocols with well-defined aims, optimal selection factors for TME receptor expression levels, functional genomic analysis focused around hotspot regions like these TP53 class 4 mutations given implications under IITV-related pathways and how these results are best applied during subsequent treatment decision-making processes that remain subject to dynamic adaptability/sensitivity to external inputs within individual patient's clinical picture in near real-time [4-5]. We also must account for variations across multiple cases here given some patients are enrolled with different disease profiles which will eventually undergo potentially contrasting response trajectory depending upon therapeutic choice even across identical genetic variants, so careful monitoring and adjustment procedures will need to be undertaken regarding selection rules when sequencing becomes available [6]. While GeoMx offers some advantages over curation processes for TME-derived material compared with RNA-seq or immUNofluorescence methods due mainly from requiring much less tissue material (only what would ordinarily be discarded per standard care rules) along with reduced turnaround needed to perform these tests, careful selection is nonetheless required since many assays are computationally time and laboriously intensive. A well coordinated workflow incorporating clinician feedback while maintaining regular interviews for these results' interpretation remains critical so it may influence clinical decision-making at an earlier phase of management before all necessary workup protocols or other planned therapies have reached the point at which their full scope becomes evident [7"}, "LLM+CEDAR": {"The patient's primary tissue is lung, so we have \"tissue": "lung\".

Given current knowledge about immunotherapies, there may have a high number of potential targets to be analyzed simultaneously leading down an incorrect or flawed approach without following standard methods ensuring validity, so experts should collaborate through publication channels whenever possible as part of disseminating the outcome following research and validation procedures set across institutions worldwide, such is found here concerning protein analysis techniques specifically tailored toward studying these cases more closely due to limitations noted in GEO records linked below.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

We observed that most of differentially expressed genes based on smoking status (smoking-responsive genes) were cell-type specific, and inter-cellular communication strength for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I and -II pathways were inverted between ever- and never-smokers. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type, and 37% of them were cell-type specific. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare epithelial cell types, including AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs from multiple GWAS loci. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including smoking-responsive genes.

TCGA LUSC and GTEx healthy donors\u2019 cohorts were used for validation. We identified 1133 up-regulated and 644 down-regulated genes, common for both cohorts. The most significant up-regulated genes were involved in cell-cycle regulation pathways, while down-regulated genes predominately belonged to immune-related pathways. Survival analysis performed on selected genes, commonly dysregulated in both cohorts and performed only on non-metastatic patients, identified novel prognostic biomarkers associated with OS in early-stage LUSC patients (HOXC4-worse OS, p=0.0001; LILRA5-better OS, p=0.0086). In total, 50 differentially expressed genes are correlated with patients\u2019 OS. Aiming to get better insight into the profile of the tumor microenvironment, we estimated levels of immune-cells infiltration in LUSC and identified 4 subtypes based on immune-cell infiltration levels.

The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses.

We used genome-wide RNA sequencing to identify LC candidate markers by comparing expression of >60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken at LC diagnosis from cases (n=128) and controls (n=62). Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Although blood neutrophils were elevated in LC cases both in the diagnostic and pre-diagnostic blood specimens, the observed associations of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP with LC were preserved also after adjusting for elevated blood neutrophils.

Advancements in spatial profiling technologies have unveiled the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, a crucial factor in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Using spatial profiling, this study investigates the effects of the MET inhibitor tepotinib on the TME in a case of locally advanced NSCLC with a METex14 skipping alteration.  Methods: A patient with resectable stage IIIB NSCLC, unresponsive to neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, received tepotinib following detection of a METex14 skipping alteration. Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were subjected to GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas and immune-related protein panels to evaluate shifts in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).  Results: Tepotinib administration resulted in pathological downstaging to stage IA1, which allowed for a successful lobectomy and evidenced a significant pathological response. The TIME was transformed from an immunosuppressive to a more permissive state, with upregulation of antigen-presenting and pro-inflammatory immune cells. Moreover, a marked decrease in immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, was noted. Spatial profiling identified discrete immune-enriched clusters, indicating the role of tepotinib in modulating immune cell trafficking and function.  Conclusions: Tepotinib appears to remodel the TIME in a patient with METex14 skipping NSCLC, possibly increasing responsiveness to immunotherapy. This case supports the integration of genetic profiling into the management of early and locally advanced NSCLC to guide personalized, targeted interventions.

The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.  Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.  Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.

As survival is linked to stage, there is a need to identify markers for earlier LC diagnosis and individualized treatment.

Further, we evaluated expression of these markers in two population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n=163 cases, 184 matched controls). We identified 14 candidate genes in whole blood associated with LC at diagnosis. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (adjusted p-values 0.009, 0.03, and 0.007, respectively). We observed strong association of ANXA3 and ARG1 expression with LC also in the pre-diagnostic blood specimens, and especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios 3.47 and 5.00, respectively).

The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset.
