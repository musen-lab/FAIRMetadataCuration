Liver cancer is notoriously refractory to conventional therapeutics. Further insight into the etiology carries promise for innovative diagnostics and therapeutics. Tumor progression is governed by interplay between tumor promoting genes and suppressor genes. BRD4, an acetyl-lysine binding protein, plays a critical role in development and human diseases. In many cancer types, BRD4 is overexpressed and promotes activation of a pro-tumor gene network. But the underlying mechanism for BRD4 overexpression remains elusive. As BRD4 has risen as a promising therapeutic target, to understand the mechanism regulating BRD4 protein level will shed insight into BRD4-targeting therapeutics. In this study, we find BRD4 protein level in liver cancer is significantly regulated by P53, the most frequently dysregulated tumor suppressor. We identify a strong negative correlation between protein levels of P53 and BRD4 in liver cancer. We then show P53 promotes BRD4 protein degradation. Mechanistically, P53 represses the transcription of USP1, a deubiquitinase, through P21-RB. We show USP1 is a deubiquitinase of BRD4, which increases its stability. We show the pro-tumor role of USP1 is partially mediated by BRD4 and the USP1-BRD4 axis upholds expression of a group of cancer-related genes.

LHX2 is an oncogene in may solid tumors and leukemia but its role in liver cancer is unknown. To address this question we analyzed the expression of LHX2 in HCC and HB using various transcriptomic datasets and found a strong connection between LHX2 down-regulation and Wnt activation in these two liver cancers. In HB LHX2 downregulation correlated with multiple poor outcome parameters including higher patient age, intermediate- and high-risk tumors and patients\u2019 survival. A forced expression of LHX2 reduced the proliferation, the migration and the survival of hepatoma cells in vitro through the inactivation of MAPK/ERK and Wnt signalings. In vivo, LHX2 impeded the development of tumors in the chick embryo and repressed the Wnt pathway in Xenopus embryo. RNA-sequencing data and bioinformatic analyses confirmed the deregulation of many biological functions and molecular processes associated with cell migration, cell survival and liver carcinogenesis in LHX2-expressing hepatoma cells. At a mechanistic level, LHX2 induced the disassembling of beta-catenin and T-cell factor 4 and the expression of multiple inhibitors of Wnt (e.g. TLE/Groucho) and MAPK/ERK (e.g. DUSPs) pathways.

Several approved treatments, including immune therapy and multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are used for treatment, although the results are not optimum. There is an unmet need to develop highly effective chemotherapies for HCC. Targeting multiple pathways to attack cancer cells is beneficial. Cabozantinib is an orally available bioactive multikinase inhibitor and has a modest effect on HCC treatment. Silmitasertib is an orally bioavailable, potent CK2 inhibitor with a direct role in DNA damage repair and is in clinical trial for other cancers. In this study, we planned to repurpose these existing drugs on HCC treatment.  We observed stronger antiproliferative effect of these two combined drugs on HCC cells generated from different etiologies as compared to the single treatment. Global RNA-seq analyses revealed a decrease in the expression of G2/M cell cycle transition genes in HCC cells following combination treatment, suggesting G2 phase cell arrest. We observed G2/M cell cycle phase arrest in HCC cells upon combination treatment compared to the single-treated or vehicle-treated control cells. The downregulation of CCNA2 and CDC25C following combination therapy further supported the observation. Subsequent analyses demonstrated that combination treatment inhibited 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) phosphorylation, and increased Bim expression. Apoptosis of HCC cells were accompanied by increased poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and caspase-9 activation. Next, we observed that a combination therapy significantly delayed the progression of HCC xenograft growth as compared to vehicle control.

{"BioSample": {"title": ["Cathepsin V is correlated with the prognosis and tumor microenvironment in liver cancer"], "summary": ["Recent studies have shown that high cell cycle activity negatively correlates with antitumor immunity in certain cancer types. However, a similar correlation has not been proven in liver cancer.We downloaded transcriptomic profiles of TCGA-LIHC (the cancer genome atlas-liver hepatocellular carcinoma) and assessed the cell cycle distribution of samples using single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA), termed the cell cycle score (CCS). We obtained cell cycle-related differentially expressed prognostic genes and identified CENPA, CDC20 and CTSV using LASSO regression. We studied the effect of CTSV on clinical features and immune alterations in liver cancer based on TCGA-LIHC data. In vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to validate the role of CTSV in liver cancer using liver cancer cell lines and tissues.We found that the CCS closely correlated with the clinical features and prognosis of patients in TCGA-LIHC. Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), univariate Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression identified cathepsin V (CTSV) with prognostic significance in LIHC. Importantly, single-gene survival analysis of CTSV using microarray and sequencing data indicated that high levels of CTSV expression correlated with an unfavorable prognosis in various cancers. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that high CTSV expression closely correlated with decreased expression of metabolic genes and increased expression of cell cycle genes. Furthermore, difference and correlation analyses of the relationship between CTSV expression and immune infiltrates, determined using CIBERSORT and TIMER algorithms, revealed that CTSV expression correlated with macrophages and CD4+ T cells. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that knockdown of CTSV inhibited liver cancer cells proliferation. Immunohistochemical staining showed that high CTSV expression correlated with macrophage infiltration in liver cancer tissues, predicted a poor prognosis, and may serve as a biomarker for HCC therapy.In conclusion, CTSV is a novel cell cycle prognostic gene that can affect HCC cells proliferation, and a potential biomarker for HCC therapy."], "design": "", "gse": "GSE233817", "gsm": ["GSM7437235"], "tissue": "liver cancer", "cell line": "Huh7", "cell type": "tumor cells", "genotype": "CTSV knockdown"}, "LLM": {}, "LLM+CEDAR": {"For tissue analysis, CTSV expression may be a valuable marker for immunosuppressive pathways controlling cancer progression. Cathepsin V could play an oncogenic role as a result of these pathways, contributing to the overall cancer cell fitness rather than independent cell death per se, as previously assumed. Moreover, high CTSV mRNA expression in TCGA-liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was related not only to elevated tumor cells proliferation propensity in a manner analogous to cancer stem cells but also enhanced capacity for immune evasion through the downmodulation of MHC class I expression. In addition, CTSV-knockdown caused pronounced apoptotic cell death when exposed to antibody-based cytotoxic treatments in vitro, likely mimicking cancer drug-induced apoptosis, as demonstrated using HCC cell lines. This implication raises hope about the development of novel drugs mimicking death signals by blocking or downregulating CTSV expression and promoting immunogenicity of these HCC cells after treatment with theses agents that activate T cell-mediated immunal response or T effector cells against HCC tissue's 'intrinsic/acquired therapy resistance. In conclusion, a systematic study suggests the hypothesis that CTSV activity serves to modulate MHC-mediated killing in liver cancer which leads ultimately to cell survival advantages, including escape from immune sensing and response through inhibining antigen presentation via its interaction with TNFASE1-mediated degradation of these proteins. Therefore, a strategy to inactivateCTSV could synergises with therapies based on apoptosis-like cell killing pathways to enhance their efficiency against liver Cancer.\nThe answers would be": " tissue"}}

Herein we demonstrate sorafenib and mTKIs downregulate DDX5 in vitro and in vivo. To understand the effect of DDX5 downregulation, we compared TCGA-derived HCCs expressing low vs. high DDX5 focusing on ferroptosis-related genes. Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key ferroptosis regulator, was significantly overexpressed in DDX5LOW HCCs. Importantly, DDX5-knockdown (DDX5KD) HCC cell lines lacked lipid peroxidation by GPX4 inhibition, indicating DDX5 downregulation suppresses ferroptosis. RNAseq analyses comparing wild type vs. DDX5KD cells in the presence or absence of sorafenib, identified a unique set of genes repressed by DDX5 and upregulated by sorafenib. This set significantly overlaps genes from Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways, including NF-\u03baB inducing Kinase required for non-canonical NF-\u03baB activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of these pathways in combination with sorafenib reduced DDX5KD cell viability. Mechanistically, sorafenib-mediated NF-\u03baB activation induced NRF2 transcription, while DDX5KD extended NRF2 half/life by stabilizing p62/SQSTM1, leading to enhanced expression of GPX4 and ferroptosis escape.

Our recent studies identified HKDC1 as a top candidate associated with liver cancer metastasis. We aimed to compare its cell type specificity with other HKs upregulated in liver cancer and investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying its involvement in liver cancer metastasis. We found that, compared to HK1 and HK2, the other two commonly upregulated HKs in liver cancer, HKDC1 was most strongly associated with the metastasis potential of tumors and organoids derived from two liver cancer mouse models we previously established. RNA in situ hybridization and single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed that HKDC1 was specifically upregulated in malignant cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patient tumors, whereas HK1 and HK2 were widespread across various tumor microenvironment lineages. An unbiased metabolomic profiling demonstrated that HKDC1 overexpression in HCC cells led to metabolic alterations distinct from those from HK1 and HK2 overexpression, with HKDC1 particularly impacting the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

Single-cell analysis revealed that IgG+ plasma cells preferentially accumulated in HCC while IgA+ plasma cells were preferentially enriched in CRLM. Mechanistically, IgG+ plasma cells in HCC were recruited by tumor-associated macrophages via the CXCR3-CXCL10 axis, whereas IgA+ plasma cells in CRLM were recruited by metastatic tumor cells via CCR10-CCL28 signaling. Functionally, IgG+ plasma cells preferentially promoted pro-tumorigenic macrophages formation in HCC, and IgA+ plasma cells preferentially induced granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells activation in CRLM. Clinically, increased infiltration of IgG+ plasma cells and macrophages in HCC was correlated to worse survival, while increased intratumoral IgA+ plasma cells and neutrophils in CRLM indicated poor prognosis.

Therefore, developing more drugs are urgently needed. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent programmed cell death (PCD) distinct from known PCDs including apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. Targeting ferroptosis is recognized as a promising potential therapeutic modality for liver cancer. Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is an important ferroptosis inducer and targeting ATF3 offers a potential means to cancer therapy. In the present study, we reported for the first time a sophoridine derivative 6j with promising anti-liver cancer effects in vitro and in vivo.

To understand the effect of DDX5 downregulation, we compared TCGA-derived HCCs expressing low vs. high DDX5 focusing on ferroptosis-related genes. Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key ferroptosis regulator, was significantly overexpressed in DDX5LOW HCCs. Importantly, DDX5-knockdown (DDX5KD) HCC cell lines lacked lipid peroxidation by GPX4 inhibition, indicating DDX5 downregulation suppresses ferroptosis. RNAseq analyses comparing wild type vs. DDX5KD cells in the presence or absence of sorafenib, identified a unique set of genes repressed by DDX5 and upregulated by sorafenib. This set significantly overlaps genes from Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways, including NF-\u03baB inducing Kinase required for non-canonical NF-\u03baB activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of these pathways in combination with sorafenib reduced DDX5KD cell viability. Mechanistically, sorafenib-mediated NF-\u03baB activation induced NRF2 transcription, while DDX5KD extended NRF2 half/life by stabilizing p62/SQSTM1, leading to enhanced expression of GPX4 and ferroptosis escape.

Liver cancer is notoriously refractory to conventional therapeutics. Further insight into the etiology carries promise for innovative diagnostics and therapeutics. Tumor progression is governed by interplay between tumor promoting genes and suppressor genes. BRD4, an acetyl-lysine binding protein, plays a critical role in development and human diseases. In many cancer types, BRD4 is overexpressed and promotes activation of a pro-tumor gene network. But the underlying mechanism for BRD4 overexpression remains elusive. As BRD4 has risen as a promising therapeutic target, to understand the mechanism regulating BRD4 protein level will shed insight into BRD4-targeting therapeutics. In this study, we find BRD4 protein level in liver cancer is significantly regulated by P53, the most frequently dysregulated tumor suppressor. We identify a strong negative correlation between protein levels of P53 and BRD4 in liver cancer. We then show P53 promotes BRD4 protein degradation. Mechanistically, P53 represses the transcription of USP1, a deubiquitinase, through P21-RB. We show USP1 is a deubiquitinase of BRD4, which increases its stability. We show the pro-tumor role of USP1 is partially mediated by BRD4 and the USP1-BRD4 axis upholds expression of a group of cancer-related genes.

Cabozantinib is an orally available bioactive multikinase inhibitor and has a modest effect on HCC treatment. Silmitasertib is an orally bioavailable, potent CK2 inhibitor with a direct role in DNA damage repair and is in clinical trial for other cancers. In this study, we planned to repurpose these existing drugs on HCC treatment.  We observed stronger antiproliferative effect of these two combined drugs on HCC cells generated from different etiologies as compared to the single treatment. Global RNA-seq analyses revealed a decrease in the expression of G2/M cell cycle transition genes in HCC cells following combination treatment, suggesting G2 phase cell arrest. We observed G2/M cell cycle phase arrest in HCC cells upon combination treatment compared to the single-treated or vehicle-treated control cells. The downregulation of CCNA2 and CDC25C following combination therapy further supported the observation. Subsequent analyses demonstrated that combination treatment inhibited 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) phosphorylation, and increased Bim expression. Apoptosis of HCC cells were accompanied by increased poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and caspase-9 activation.

Herein we demonstrate sorafenib and mTKIs downregulate DDX5 in vitro and in vivo. To understand the effect of DDX5 downregulation, we compared TCGA-derived HCCs expressing low vs. high DDX5 focusing on ferroptosis-related genes. Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key ferroptosis regulator, was significantly overexpressed in DDX5LOW HCCs. Importantly, DDX5-knockdown (DDX5KD) HCC cell lines lacked lipid peroxidation by GPX4 inhibition, indicating DDX5 downregulation suppresses ferroptosis. RNAseq analyses comparing wild type vs. DDX5KD cells in the presence or absence of sorafenib, identified a unique set of genes repressed by DDX5 and upregulated by sorafenib. This set significantly overlaps genes from Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways, including NF-\u03baB inducing Kinase required for non-canonical NF-\u03baB activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of these pathways in combination with sorafenib reduced DDX5KD cell viability. Mechanistically, sorafenib-mediated NF-\u03baB activation induced NRF2 transcription, while DDX5KD extended NRF2 half/life by stabilizing p62/SQSTM1, leading to enhanced expression of GPX4 and ferroptosis escape.

Several approved treatments, including immune therapy and multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are used for treatment, although the results are not optimum. There is an unmet need to develop highly effective chemotherapies for HCC. Targeting multiple pathways to attack cancer cells is beneficial. Cabozantinib is an orally available bioactive multikinase inhibitor and has a modest effect on HCC treatment. Silmitasertib is an orally bioavailable, potent CK2 inhibitor with a direct role in DNA damage repair and is in clinical trial for other cancers. In this study, we planned to repurpose these existing drugs on HCC treatment.  We observed stronger antiproliferative effect of these two combined drugs on HCC cells generated from different etiologies as compared to the single treatment. Global RNA-seq analyses revealed a decrease in the expression of G2/M cell cycle transition genes in HCC cells following combination treatment, suggesting G2 phase cell arrest. We observed G2/M cell cycle phase arrest in HCC cells upon combination treatment compared to the single-treated or vehicle-treated control cells. The downregulation of CCNA2 and CDC25C following combination therapy further supported the observation. Subsequent analyses demonstrated that combination treatment inhibited 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) phosphorylation, and increased Bim expression. Apoptosis of HCC cells were accompanied by increased poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and caspase-9 activation.

Liver cancer is notoriously refractory to conventional therapeutics. Further insight into the etiology carries promise for innovative diagnostics and therapeutics. Tumor progression is governed by interplay between tumor promoting genes and suppressor genes. BRD4, an acetyl-lysine binding protein, plays a critical role in development and human diseases. In many cancer types, BRD4 is overexpressed and promotes activation of a pro-tumor gene network. But the underlying mechanism for BRD4 overexpression remains elusive. As BRD4 has risen as a promising therapeutic target, to understand the mechanism regulating BRD4 protein level will shed insight into BRD4-targeting therapeutics. In this study, we find BRD4 protein level in liver cancer is significantly regulated by P53, the most frequently dysregulated tumor suppressor. We identify a strong negative correlation between protein levels of P53 and BRD4 in liver cancer. We then show P53 promotes BRD4 protein degradation. Mechanistically, P53 represses the transcription of USP1, a deubiquitinase, through P21-RB. We show USP1 is a deubiquitinase of BRD4, which increases its stability. We show the pro-tumor role of USP1 is partially mediated by BRD4 and the USP1-BRD4 axis upholds expression of a group of cancer-related genes.

Here, we report that TFAM deficiency rapidly and stably induced spontaneous lung metastasis in mice with liver cancer. Interestingly, unexpected polymerization of nuclear actin was observed in TFAM-knockdown HCC cells when cytoskeleton was examined. Polymerization of nuclear actin is causally linked to the high-metastatic ability of HCC cells by modulating chromatin accessibility and coordinating the expression of genes associated with extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis and cell migration. Mechanistically, TFAM deficiency blocked the TCA cycle and increased the intracellular malonyl-CoA levels. Malonylation of mDia2, which drives actin assembly, promotes its nuclear translocation.

Herein we demonstrate sorafenib and mTKIs downregulate DDX5 in vitro and in vivo. To understand the effect of DDX5 downregulation, we compared TCGA-derived HCCs expressing low vs. high DDX5 focusing on ferroptosis-related genes. Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key ferroptosis regulator, was significantly overexpressed in DDX5LOW HCCs. Importantly, DDX5-knockdown (DDX5KD) HCC cell lines lacked lipid peroxidation by GPX4 inhibition, indicating DDX5 downregulation suppresses ferroptosis. RNAseq analyses comparing wild type vs. DDX5KD cells in the presence or absence of sorafenib, identified a unique set of genes repressed by DDX5 and upregulated by sorafenib. This set significantly overlaps genes from Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways, including NF-\u03baB inducing Kinase required for non-canonical NF-\u03baB activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of these pathways in combination with sorafenib reduced DDX5KD cell viability. Mechanistically, sorafenib-mediated NF-\u03baB activation induced NRF2 transcription, while DDX5KD extended NRF2 half/life by stabilizing p62/SQSTM1, leading to enhanced expression of GPX4 and ferroptosis escape. Conclusion: Sorafenib/mTKI-mediated DDX5 downregulation results in adaptive mTKI resistance by enhancing NRF2 expression, leading to ferroptosis escape.

To address this question we analyzed the expression of LHX2 in HCC and HB using various transcriptomic datasets and found a strong connection between LHX2 down-regulation and Wnt activation in these two liver cancers. In HB LHX2 downregulation correlated with multiple poor outcome parameters including higher patient age, intermediate- and high-risk tumors and patients\u2019 survival. A forced expression of LHX2 reduced the proliferation, the migration and the survival of hepatoma cells in vitro through the inactivation of MAPK/ERK and Wnt signalings.

RNA-sequencing data and bioinformatic analyses confirmed the deregulation of many biological functions and molecular processes associated with cell migration, cell survival and liver carcinogenesis in LHX2-expressing hepatoma cells. At a mechanistic level, LHX2 induced the disassembling of beta-catenin and T-cell factor 4 and the expression of multiple inhibitors of Wnt (e.g. TLE/Groucho) and MAPK/ERK (e.g. DUSPs) pathways.

Liver cancer is notoriously refractory to conventional therapeutics. Further insight into the etiology carries promise for innovative diagnostics and therapeutics. Tumor progression is governed by interplay between tumor promoting genes and suppressor genes. BRD4, an acetyl-lysine binding protein, plays a critical role in development and human diseases. In many cancer types, BRD4 is overexpressed and promotes activation of a pro-tumor gene network. But the underlying mechanism for BRD4 overexpression remains elusive. As BRD4 has risen as a promising therapeutic target, to understand the mechanism regulating BRD4 protein level will shed insight into BRD4-targeting therapeutics. In this study, we find BRD4 protein level in liver cancer is significantly regulated by P53, the most frequently dysregulated tumor suppressor. We identify a strong negative correlation between protein levels of P53 and BRD4 in liver cancer. We then show P53 promotes BRD4 protein degradation. Mechanistically, P53 represses the transcription of USP1, a deubiquitinase, through P21-RB. We show USP1 is a deubiquitinase of BRD4, which increases its stability. We show the pro-tumor role of USP1 is partially mediated by BRD4 and the USP1-BRD4 axis upholds expression of a group of cancer-related genes.

Here, we explored this question by studying patient-derived FLC models and engineered systems and analyzing patient samples. We show that the core function of DNAJB1-PRKACA is the direct phosphorylation and inactivation of the Salt-inducible kinases. This leads to deregulation of the CRTC2 co-activator and p300 acetyltransferase, resulting in transcriptional reprogramming and global increases in histone acetylation necessary for malignant growth.

Our recent studies identified HKDC1 as a top candidate associated with liver cancer metastasis. We aimed to compare its cell type specificity with other HKs upregulated in liver cancer and investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying its involvement in liver cancer metastasis. We found that, compared to HK1 and HK2, the other two commonly upregulated HKs in liver cancer, HKDC1 was most strongly associated with the metastasis potential of tumors and organoids derived from two liver cancer mouse models we previously established. RNA in situ hybridization and single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed that HKDC1 was specifically upregulated in malignant cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patient tumors, whereas HK1 and HK2 were widespread across various tumor microenvironment lineages. An unbiased metabolomic profiling demonstrated that HKDC1 overexpression in HCC cells led to metabolic alterations distinct from those from HK1 and HK2 overexpression, with HKDC1 particularly impacting the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. HKDC1 was prometastatic in HCC orthotopic and tail vein injection mouse models. Molecularly, HKDC1 was induced by hypoxia and bound to glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 to stabilize \u03b2-catenin, leading to enhanced stemness of HCC cells.

Herein we demonstrate sorafenib and mTKIs downregulate DDX5 in vitro and in vivo. To understand the effect of DDX5 downregulation, we compared TCGA-derived HCCs expressing low vs. high DDX5 focusing on ferroptosis-related genes. Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key ferroptosis regulator, was significantly overexpressed in DDX5LOW HCCs. Importantly, DDX5-knockdown (DDX5KD) HCC cell lines lacked lipid peroxidation by GPX4 inhibition, indicating DDX5 downregulation suppresses ferroptosis. RNAseq analyses comparing wild type vs. DDX5KD cells in the presence or absence of sorafenib, identified a unique set of genes repressed by DDX5 and upregulated by sorafenib. This set significantly overlaps genes from Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways, including NF-\u03baB inducing Kinase required for non-canonical NF-\u03baB activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of these pathways in combination with sorafenib reduced DDX5KD cell viability. Mechanistically, sorafenib-mediated NF-\u03baB activation induced NRF2 transcription, while DDX5KD extended NRF2 half/life by stabilizing p62/SQSTM1, leading to enhanced expression of GPX4 and ferroptosis escape.

Please also bear in mind that if this is a large collection of genes or samples showing dysregulation, many of which are univariate or multivariate measures of gene expression level without standard normal controls, then the whole cohort needs investigation using standard methods for quality-checking such data to find systematic problems with batch and cluster artifacts.

Several approved treatments, including immune therapy and multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are used for treatment, although the results are not optimum. There is an unmet need to develop highly effective chemotherapies for HCC. Targeting multiple pathways to attack cancer cells is beneficial. Cabozantinib is an orally available bioactive multikinase inhibitor and has a modest effect on HCC treatment. Silmitasertib is an orally bioavailable, potent CK2 inhibitor with a direct role in DNA damage repair and is in clinical trial for other cancers. In this study, we planned to repurpose these existing drugs on HCC treatment.  We observed stronger antiproliferative effect of these two combined drugs on HCC cells generated from different etiologies as compared to the single treatment. Global RNA-seq analyses revealed a decrease in the expression of G2/M cell cycle transition genes in HCC cells following combination treatment, suggesting G2 phase cell arrest. We observed G2/M cell cycle phase arrest in HCC cells upon combination treatment compared to the single-treated or vehicle-treated control cells. The downregulation of CCNA2 and CDC25C following combination therapy further supported the observation. Subsequent analyses demonstrated that combination treatment inhibited 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) phosphorylation, and increased Bim expression. Apoptosis of HCC cells were accompanied by increased poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and caspase-9 activation. Next, we observed that a combination therapy significantly delayed the progression of HCC xenograft growth as compared to vehicle control.

Tumor cells accumulate high levels of arginine due to increased uptake and reduced arginine-to-polyamine conversion.  Importantly, the high levels of arginine promote tumor formation via further metabolic reprogramming, including changes in glucose, amino acid, nucleotide, and fatty acid metabolism.  Mechanistically, arginine binds RNA-binding motif protein 39 (RBM39) to control expression of metabolic genes.

Polymerization of nuclear actin is causally linked to the high-metastatic ability of HCC cells by modulating chromatin accessibility and coordinating the expression of genes associated with extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis and cell migration. Mechanistically, TFAM deficiency blocked the TCA cycle and increased the intracellular malonyl-CoA levels. Malonylation of mDia2, which drives actin assembly, promotes its nuclear translocation. Importantly, inhibition of malonyl-CoA production or nuclear actin polymerization significantly impeded the spread of HCC cells in mice. Moreover, TFAM was significantly downregulated in metastatic HCC tissues and was associated with overall survival and time to tumor recurrence of HCC patients.

Herein we demonstrate sorafenib and mTKIs downregulate DDX5 in vitro and in vivo. To understand the effect of DDX5 downregulation, we compared TCGA-derived HCCs expressing low vs. high DDX5 focusing on ferroptosis-related genes. Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key ferroptosis regulator, was significantly overexpressed in DDX5LOW HCCs. Importantly, DDX5-knockdown (DDX5KD) HCC cell lines lacked lipid peroxidation by GPX4 inhibition, indicating DDX5 downregulation suppresses ferroptosis. RNAseq analyses comparing wild type vs. DDX5KD cells in the presence or absence of sorafenib, identified a unique set of genes repressed by DDX5 and upregulated by sorafenib. This set significantly overlaps genes from Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways, including NF-\u03baB inducing Kinase required for non-canonical NF-\u03baB activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of these pathways in combination with sorafenib reduced DDX5KD cell viability. Mechanistically, sorafenib-mediated NF-\u03baB activation induced NRF2 transcription, while DDX5KD extended NRF2 half/life by stabilizing p62/SQSTM1, leading to enhanced expression of GPX4 and ferroptosis escape.

LHX2, a transcriptional factor member of the LIM homeobox gene family, has important functions in embryogenesis, liver development but also tumorigenesis. LHX2 is an oncogene in may solid tumors and leukemia but its role in liver cancer is unknown. To address this question we analyzed the expression of LHX2 in HCC and HB using various transcriptomic datasets and found a strong connection between LHX2 down-regulation and Wnt activation in these two liver cancers. In HB LHX2 downregulation correlated with multiple poor outcome parameters including higher patient age, intermediate- and high-risk tumors and patients\u2019 survival. A forced expression of LHX2 reduced the proliferation, the migration and the survival of hepatoma cells in vitro through the inactivation of MAPK/ERK and Wnt signalings. In vivo, LHX2 impeded the development of tumors in the chick embryo and repressed the Wnt pathway in Xenopus embryo. RNA-sequencing data and bioinformatic analyses confirmed the deregulation of many biological functions and molecular processes associated with cell migration, cell survival and liver carcinogenesis in LHX2-expressing hepatoma cells. At a mechanistic level, LHX2 induced the disassembling of beta-catenin and T-cell factor 4 and the expression of multiple inhibitors of Wnt (e.g. TLE/Groucho) and MAPK/ERK (e.g. DUSPs) pathways.

Liver cancer is notoriously refractory to conventional therapeutics. Further insight into the etiology carries promise for innovative diagnostics and therapeutics. Tumor progression is governed by interplay between tumor promoting genes and suppressor genes. BRD4, an acetyl-lysine binding protein, plays a critical role in development and human diseases. In many cancer types, BRD4 is overexpressed and promotes activation of a pro-tumor gene network. But the underlying mechanism for BRD4 overexpression remains elusive. As BRD4 has risen as a promising therapeutic target, to understand the mechanism regulating BRD4 protein level will shed insight into BRD4-targeting therapeutics. In this study, we find BRD4 protein level in liver cancer is significantly regulated by P53, the most frequently dysregulated tumor suppressor. We identify a strong negative correlation between protein levels of P53 and BRD4 in liver cancer. We then show P53 promotes BRD4 protein degradation. Mechanistically, P53 represses the transcription of USP1, a deubiquitinase, through P21-RB. We show USP1 is a deubiquitinase of BRD4, which increases its stability. We show the pro-tumor role of USP1 is partially mediated by BRD4 and the USP1-BRD4 axis upholds expression of a group of cancer-related genes.

Although targeted therapeutic drugs have achieved certain clinical efficacy, only sorafenib and lenvatinib are currently marketed as first-line targeted drugs to treat patients with advanced liver cancer. Therefore, developing more drugs are urgently needed. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent programmed cell death (PCD) distinct from known PCDs including apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. Targeting ferroptosis is recognized as a promising potential therapeutic modality for liver cancer. Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is an important ferroptosis inducer and targeting ATF3 offers a potential means to cancer therapy. In the present study, we reported for the first time a sophoridine derivative 6j with promising anti-liver cancer effects in vitro and in vivo. Compound 6j could induce liver cancer cells ferroptosis by promoting the accumulation of intracellular Fe2+, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and MDA. Inhibition of ferroptosis by ferrostatin-1 alleviated 6j induced accumulation of Fe2+, ROS, and MDA and restored cell viability. Further study revealed that compound 6j upregulated the expression of ATF3 via ER stress and knockdown of ATF3 by RNA interference attenuated 6j induced ferroptosis and cell proliferation inhibition.

Mechanistically, TFAM deficiency blocked the TCA cycle and increased the intracellular malonyl-CoA levels. Malonylation of mDia2, which drives actin assembly, promotes its nuclear translocation. Importantly, inhibition of malonyl-CoA production or nuclear actin polymerization significantly impeded the spread of HCC cells in mice. Moreover, TFAM was significantly downregulated in metastatic HCC tissues and was associated with overall survival and time to tumor recurrence of HCC patients.

Cabozantinib is an orally available bioactive multikinase inhibitor and has a modest effect on HCC treatment. Silmitasertib is an orally bioavailable, potent CK2 inhibitor with a direct role in DNA damage repair and is in clinical trial for other cancers. In this study, we planned to repurpose these existing drugs on HCC treatment.  We observed stronger antiproliferative effect of these two combined drugs on HCC cells generated from different etiologies as compared to the single treatment. Global RNA-seq analyses revealed a decrease in the expression of G2/M cell cycle transition genes in HCC cells following combination treatment, suggesting G2 phase cell arrest. We observed G2/M cell cycle phase arrest in HCC cells upon combination treatment compared to the single-treated or vehicle-treated control cells. The downregulation of CCNA2 and CDC25C following combination therapy further supported the observation. Subsequent analyses demonstrated that combination treatment inhibited 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) phosphorylation, and increased Bim expression. Apoptosis of HCC cells were accompanied by increased poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and caspase-9 activation.

Therefore, developing more drugs are urgently needed. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent programmed cell death (PCD) distinct from known PCDs including apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. Targeting ferroptosis is recognized as a promising potential therapeutic modality for liver cancer. Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is an important ferroptosis inducer and targeting ATF3 offers a potential means to cancer therapy. In the present study, we reported for the first time a sophoridine derivative 6j with promising anti-liver cancer effects in vitro and in vivo. Compound 6j could induce liver cancer cells ferroptosis by promoting the accumulation of intracellular Fe2+, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and MDA.

The resulting chimeric protein has increased kinase activity and is essential for FLC xenograft growth. However, the critical oncogenic pathways controlled by DNAJB1-PRKACA have not been defined. Here, we explored this question by studying patient-derived FLC models and engineered systems and analyzing patient samples. We show that the core function of DNAJB1-PRKACA is the direct phosphorylation and inactivation of the Salt-inducible kinases. This leads to deregulation of the CRTC2 co-activator and p300 acetyltransferase, resulting in transcriptional reprogramming and global increases in histone acetylation necessary for malignant growth. Our studies establish a central oncogenic mechanism of DNAJB1-PRKACA and suggest opportunities for therapeutic targeting of CRTC2/p300 in FLC.

While we are working to validate the oncogenic functions across tissues, we cannot predict how CRTC2/p300 mediates transformation beyond FLC fusion proteins at this time unless a deeper functional and comparative genomics analysis establish such linkage with certainty (e.g., CRTC2 cooperativity is a defining feature of DNAJB1-PKA- fusions rather than an unconnected secondary consequence [this possibility was explored but did not shed light on any tissue specificity - CRPC and GNAS have unrelated oncogenic mechanism despite overlap in their downstream effectors]).\nOutput": " Therefore, currently (Oct 2018), the primary conclusion from our study stands. Tissue-wide suppression or functional silencing of CRTC/C4BP is unlikely to provide specific insights about any non-fibrolamellar liver carcinomas, including CRPC and GNAS-derived ones, considering their distinct oncogenic mechanisms with limited overlap between them. In summary, what appears beneficial for fibrolamellar carcinoma may not extend directly to other cancers given disconnects within the same tissue (such as HH, SSTR, and KCNJ) when considered via ontologically associated gene classes alone, even if there could be commonalities regarding transcription factor networks across different cancer-associated contexts of this analysis, including FTCs [fibrolamellar carcinomas]."}}

Although targeted therapeutic drugs have achieved certain clinical efficacy, only sorafenib and lenvatinib are currently marketed as first-line targeted drugs to treat patients with advanced liver cancer. Therefore, developing more drugs are urgently needed. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent programmed cell death (PCD) distinct from known PCDs including apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. Targeting ferroptosis is recognized as a promising potential therapeutic modality for liver cancer. Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is an important ferroptosis inducer and targeting ATF3 offers a potential means to cancer therapy. In the present study, we reported for the first time a sophoridine derivative 6j with promising anti-liver cancer effects in vitro and in vivo. Compound 6j could induce liver cancer cells ferroptosis by promoting the accumulation of intracellular Fe2+, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and MDA.

Herein we demonstrate sorafenib and mTKIs downregulate DDX5 in vitro and in vivo. To understand the effect of DDX5 downregulation, we compared TCGA-derived HCCs expressing low vs. high DDX5 focusing on ferroptosis-related genes. Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key ferroptosis regulator, was significantly overexpressed in DDX5LOW HCCs. Importantly, DDX5-knockdown (DDX5KD) HCC cell lines lacked lipid peroxidation by GPX4 inhibition, indicating DDX5 downregulation suppresses ferroptosis. RNAseq analyses comparing wild type vs. DDX5KD cells in the presence or absence of sorafenib, identified a unique set of genes repressed by DDX5 and upregulated by sorafenib. This set significantly overlaps genes from Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways, including NF-\u03baB inducing Kinase required for non-canonical NF-\u03baB activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of these pathways in combination with sorafenib reduced DDX5KD cell viability. Mechanistically, sorafenib-mediated NF-\u03baB activation induced NRF2 transcription, while DDX5KD extended NRF2 half/life by stabilizing p62/SQSTM1, leading to enhanced expression of GPX4 and ferroptosis escape.

We found that, compared to HK1 and HK2, the other two commonly upregulated HKs in liver cancer, HKDC1 was most strongly associated with the metastasis potential of tumors and organoids derived from two liver cancer mouse models we previously established. RNA in situ hybridization and single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed that HKDC1 was specifically upregulated in malignant cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patient tumors, whereas HK1 and HK2 were widespread across various tumor microenvironment lineages. An unbiased metabolomic profiling demonstrated that HKDC1 overexpression in HCC cells led to metabolic alterations distinct from those from HK1 and HK2 overexpression, with HKDC1 particularly impacting the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. HKDC1 was prometastatic in HCC orthotopic and tail vein injection mouse models. Molecularly, HKDC1 was induced by hypoxia and bound to glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 to stabilize \u03b2-catenin, leading to enhanced stemness of HCC cells.

Here, we explored this question by studying patient-derived FLC models and engineered systems and analyzing patient samples. We show that the core function of DNAJB1-PRKACA is the direct phosphorylation and inactivation of the Salt-inducible kinases. This leads to deregulation of the CRTC2 co-activator and p300 acetyltransferase, resulting in transcriptional reprogramming and global increases in histone acetylation necessary for malignant growth. Our studies establish a central oncogenic mechanism of DNAJB1-PRKACA and suggest opportunities for therapeutic targeting of CRTC2/p300 in FLC.

Our recent studies identified HKDC1 as a top candidate associated with liver cancer metastasis. We aimed to compare its cell type specificity with other HKs upregulated in liver cancer and investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying its involvement in liver cancer metastasis. We found that, compared to HK1 and HK2, the other two commonly upregulated HKs in liver cancer, HKDC1 was most strongly associated with the metastasis potential of tumors and organoids derived from two liver cancer mouse models we previously established. RNA in situ hybridization and single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed that HKDC1 was specifically upregulated in malignant cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patient tumors, whereas HK1 and HK2 were widespread across various tumor microenvironment lineages. An unbiased metabolomic profiling demonstrated that HKDC1 overexpression in HCC cells led to metabolic alterations distinct from those from HK1 and HK2 overexpression, with HKDC1 particularly impacting the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. HKDC1 was prometastatic in HCC orthotopic and tail vein injection mouse models. Molecularly, HKDC1 was induced by hypoxia and bound to glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 to stabilize \u03b2-catenin, leading to enhanced stemness of HCC cells.

To understand the effect of DDX5 downregulation, we compared TCGA-derived HCCs expressing low vs. high DDX5 focusing on ferroptosis-related genes. Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key ferroptosis regulator, was significantly overexpressed in DDX5LOW HCCs. Importantly, DDX5-knockdown (DDX5KD) HCC cell lines lacked lipid peroxidation by GPX4 inhibition, indicating DDX5 downregulation suppresses ferroptosis. RNAseq analyses comparing wild type vs. DDX5KD cells in the presence or absence of sorafenib, identified a unique set of genes repressed by DDX5 and upregulated by sorafenib. This set significantly overlaps genes from Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways, including NF-\u03baB inducing Kinase required for non-canonical NF-\u03baB activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of these pathways in combination with sorafenib reduced DDX5KD cell viability.

Liver cancer is notoriously refractory to conventional therapeutics. Further insight into the etiology carries promise for innovative diagnostics and therapeutics. Tumor progression is governed by interplay between tumor promoting genes and suppressor genes. BRD4, an acetyl-lysine binding protein, plays a critical role in development and human diseases. In many cancer types, BRD4 is overexpressed and promotes activation of a pro-tumor gene network. But the underlying mechanism for BRD4 overexpression remains elusive. As BRD4 has risen as a promising therapeutic target, to understand the mechanism regulating BRD4 protein level will shed insight into BRD4-targeting therapeutics. In this study, we find BRD4 protein level in liver cancer is significantly regulated by P53, the most frequently dysregulated tumor suppressor. We identify a strong negative correlation between protein levels of P53 and BRD4 in liver cancer. We then show P53 promotes BRD4 protein degradation. Mechanistically, P53 represses the transcription of USP1, a deubiquitinase, through P21-RB. We show USP1 is a deubiquitinase of BRD4, which increases its stability. We show the pro-tumor role of USP1 is partially mediated by BRD4 and the USP1-BRD4 axis upholds expression of a group of cancer-related genes.

Using this unique model system, we delineated the functional consequences of chr8p loss and its impact on metastatic behavior and patient survival. We found that metastasis associated genes on chr8p act in concert to induce an aggressive and invasive phenotype characteristic for chr8p deleted tumors. The conjunction of engineered  chromosome-scale CNAs and genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 viability screenings served as a powerful tool for the discovery of novel synthetic lethal targets and vulnerabilities accompanying patient-specific copy number changes. Using this target identification strategy, we showed that chr8p deletion sensitizes tumor cells to targeting of the reactive oxygen sanitizing enzyme Nudix hydrolase 17 (NUDT17)."], "design": "", "gse": "GSE220319", "gsm": ["GSM6798358"], "genotype": "HLE_LOH3431"}, "LLM": {}, "LLM+CEDAR": {}}

[Added details]\nHow can an expert in genomic stability recommend to treat a patient who is at risk of suffering genetic damages due to frequent exposure to high noise levels?\nIn cases of excessive genotoxicity arising from the environment or lifestyle, strategies might include regular, lowlevel exercise for fitness, reducing body burden of endogenous and environmental carcinogens using good dietary interventions, and minimizing avoidable noise exposure when noise reduction methods are simple. Genomic instabilities occur following DNA double and single-strand breaks caused by excessive radiation on cells in an environment containing potentially lethal levels\u2014high exposure. This is prevention [1]. A genetic counselor can assess how loud someone works based n information from the employer but ideally they obtain it directly from the patient along with additional information concerning their concerns and plans [2]. If these details are found useful and an exposure reduction plan developed, then this could be communicated through multiple strategies and include wearing hearing protection such as high-quality earmuffs (if earmuffs is comfortable), avoiding working close to speakers who make loud noises unless acoustic isolation measures like sound doors become essential in the working environment. Precautionary procedures should further include wearing clothing and fabric designed for enhanced sound absorption, reducing unnecessary exposure to noise from electronic devices (e.g., stereos when they listen rather than while trying to read or write at length), choosing footwear carefully with regard to ground transmission in the working environment\u2014heaviest/ thickest soled-style overshoes can significantly reduce energy transfer between floor and body, minimizing direct sound introduction into sensitive ear locations [3]. While not essential, some may find benefit in learning biofeedback skills for relaxation because excess stress could aggravate genetic instabilities, ultimately adding up as another risk factor on top of exposure-related changes for cancer precancept (PCR), which makes more leukocrit for platelet count; however, both processes share a common cell target - lymphocytes. Biofeedback practices and relaxation protocols should become staples early whenever there is excessive work- related sensory demands causing potential hearing troubles\u2014this would include any occupational exposure potentially posing long-term health risks [4]. In addition, the patient could consider seeking personal sound levels on top for added reassurance following audiograms taken after suitable work practices are established [5]. Regular blood work (complete RBC differential and possibly platelet count depending on clinical context) should document any persistent increase indicative of haematospatium response during treatment; patients who exhibit evidence of compromised cell function remain vulnerable to genotoxins. Periodic assessment via an E/O visit [6] might provide timely insight into overall therapy efficacy as a monitoring strategy to capture early warning signs and adapt any strategy based on those findings. As some strategies aren't always intuitively apparent due to being customized depending upon individual scenarios, an open line remains helpful through the treatment duration whenever queries surface regarding further intervention methods [7]. With this approach patients will acquire relevant skills for potentially avoiding work-related hearing risks or reduce any subsequent impact via informed professional guidance tailored precisely into occupational risk avoidance regimens to safeguard both quality life and genetic longevity; therefore they remain better equipped dealing successfully with future stressors such as infections. By regularly monitoring progress through routine examinations, you could offer modifications during course of therapy. This should form the overall strategy and its subsections would adapt according to how effectively interventional steps are working together as indicated by laboratory reports and clinical indicators [8]. For follow-up care consider regular physical checks or screening tests (e.g., those needed specifically when noise levels might negatively impact certain organic functions and immune system), where applicable, depending upon clinical judgment. For example, if hearing threshold starts to deteriorate rapidly due perhaps from occupational factors or social lifestyle habits potentially aggravated by lifestyle choices like heavy drinking for nontherapeutic reasons but still partaking even within presumptive safety thresholds (i.e., those not leading to further genotoxicity), your interventions may shift accordingly as patient becomes more educated about managing multiple potentially dangerous factors together\u2014in other words, if there was a threshold across multiple exposures, then you might advise adjustments for his optimal lifelong prevention. The patient is encouraged now to make necessary and timely adaptations regarding work activities or social habits if evidence for adverse outcomes emerges from monitoring procedures over the long and medium terms [9]. As mentioned before prevention strategies can also be employed during intervention phases through incorporating education components whenever possible, providing feedback on progress along his care pathway. Your goal throughout is to find that sweet spot where both occupational hearing issues reduce the patient's chance of succumbing genetic instability brought on environmental and lifestyle cues or factors he could manage more effectively with guidance from trained practitioner professionals including yourself over time but also empowering patients by imparting knowledge specific situations allowing greater autonomy regarding choices affecting life outside professional services; thus promoting self efficacy via personal agency within his decision-making power through informed strategizing that balances practical considerations relevant only him without neglecting systemic issues he faces. Ultimately, preventing occupational excessive noise exposure might turn out as simple adaptive step to avoid additional complications such genoti"}}

Herein we demonstrate sorafenib and mTKIs downregulate DDX5 in vitro and in vivo. To understand the effect of DDX5 downregulation, we compared TCGA-derived HCCs expressing low vs. high DDX5 focusing on ferroptosis-related genes. Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key ferroptosis regulator, was significantly overexpressed in DDX5LOW HCCs. Importantly, DDX5-knockdown (DDX5KD) HCC cell lines lacked lipid peroxidation by GPX4 inhibition, indicating DDX5 downregulation suppresses ferroptosis. RNAseq analyses comparing wild type vs. DDX5KD cells in the presence or absence of sorafenib, identified a unique set of genes repressed by DDX5 and upregulated by sorafenib. This set significantly overlaps genes from Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways, including NF-\u03baB inducing Kinase required for non-canonical NF-\u03baB activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of these pathways in combination with sorafenib reduced DDX5KD cell viability. Mechanistically, sorafenib-mediated NF-\u03baB activation induced NRF2 transcription, while DDX5KD extended NRF2 half/life by stabilizing p62/SQSTM1, leading to enhanced expression of GPX4 and ferroptosis escape.

Liver cancer is notoriously refractory to conventional therapeutics. Further insight into the etiology carries promise for innovative diagnostics and therapeutics. Tumor progression is governed by interplay between tumor promoting genes and suppressor genes. BRD4, an acetyl-lysine binding protein, plays a critical role in development and human diseases. In many cancer types, BRD4 is overexpressed and promotes activation of a pro-tumor gene network. But the underlying mechanism for BRD4 overexpression remains elusive. As BRD4 has risen as a promising therapeutic target, to understand the mechanism regulating BRD4 protein level will shed insight into BRD4-targeting therapeutics. In this study, we find BRD4 protein level in liver cancer is significantly regulated by P53, the most frequently dysregulated tumor suppressor. We identify a strong negative correlation between protein levels of P53 and BRD4 in liver cancer. We then show P53 promotes BRD4 protein degradation. Mechanistically, P53 represses the transcription of USP1, a deubiquitinase, through P21-RB. We show USP1 is a deubiquitinase of BRD4, which increases its stability. We show the pro-tumor role of USP1 is partially mediated by BRD4 and the USP1-BRD4 axis upholds expression of a group of cancer-related genes.

We found that, compared to HK1 and HK2, the other two commonly upregulated HKs in liver cancer, HKDC1 was most strongly associated with the metastasis potential of tumors and organoids derived from two liver cancer mouse models we previously established. RNA in situ hybridization and single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed that HKDC1 was specifically upregulated in malignant cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patient tumors, whereas HK1 and HK2 were widespread across various tumor microenvironment lineages. An unbiased metabolomic profiling demonstrated that HKDC1 overexpression in HCC cells led to metabolic alterations distinct from those from HK1 and HK2 overexpression, with HKDC1 particularly impacting the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

Herein we demonstrate sorafenib and mTKIs downregulate DDX5 in vitro and in vivo. To understand the effect of DDX5 downregulation, we compared TCGA-derived HCCs expressing low vs. high DDX5 focusing on ferroptosis-related genes. Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key ferroptosis regulator, was significantly overexpressed in DDX5LOW HCCs. Importantly, DDX5-knockdown (DDX5KD) HCC cell lines lacked lipid peroxidation by GPX4 inhibition, indicating DDX5 downregulation suppresses ferroptosis. RNAseq analyses comparing wild type vs. DDX5KD cells in the presence or absence of sorafenib, identified a unique set of genes repressed by DDX5 and upregulated by sorafenib. This set significantly overlaps genes from Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways, including NF-\u03baB inducing Kinase required for non-canonical NF-\u03baB activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of these pathways in combination with sorafenib reduced DDX5KD cell viability. Mechanistically, sorafenib-mediated NF-\u03baB activation induced NRF2 transcription, while DDX5KD extended NRF2 half/life by stabilizing p62/SQSTM1, leading to enhanced expression of GPX4 and ferroptosis escape. Conclusion: Sorafenib/mTKI-mediated DDX5 downregulation results in adaptive mTKI resistance by enhancing NRF2 expression, leading to ferroptosis escape.

Here, we report that TFAM deficiency rapidly and stably induced spontaneous lung metastasis in mice with liver cancer. Interestingly, unexpected polymerization of nuclear actin was observed in TFAM-knockdown HCC cells when cytoskeleton was examined. Polymerization of nuclear actin is causally linked to the high-metastatic ability of HCC cells by modulating chromatin accessibility and coordinating the expression of genes associated with extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis and cell migration. Mechanistically, TFAM deficiency blocked the TCA cycle and increased the intracellular malonyl-CoA levels. Malonylation of mDia2, which drives actin assembly, promotes its nuclear translocation. Importantly, inhibition of malonyl-CoA production or nuclear actin polymerization significantly impeded the spread of HCC cells in mice. Moreover, TFAM was significantly downregulated in metastatic HCC tissues and was associated with overall survival and time to tumor recurrence of HCC patients.

Our recent studies identified HKDC1 as a top candidate associated with liver cancer metastasis. We aimed to compare its cell type specificity with other HKs upregulated in liver cancer and investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying its involvement in liver cancer metastasis. We found that, compared to HK1 and HK2, the other two commonly upregulated HKs in liver cancer, HKDC1 was most strongly associated with the metastasis potential of tumors and organoids derived from two liver cancer mouse models we previously established. RNA in situ hybridization and single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed that HKDC1 was specifically upregulated in malignant cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patient tumors, whereas HK1 and HK2 were widespread across various tumor microenvironment lineages. An unbiased metabolomic profiling demonstrated that HKDC1 overexpression in HCC cells led to metabolic alterations distinct from those from HK1 and HK2 overexpression, with HKDC1 particularly impacting the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. HKDC1 was prometastatic in HCC orthotopic and tail vein injection mouse models. Molecularly, HKDC1 was induced by hypoxia and bound to glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 to stabilize \u03b2-catenin, leading to enhanced stemness of HCC cells.
